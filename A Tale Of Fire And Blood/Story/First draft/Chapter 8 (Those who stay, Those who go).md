# Chapter 8 (Those who stay, Those who go)

Meanwhile, in Orelia, stone walls kept their silence. Afternoon light slanted across the council chamber, catching dust motes in its sweep. The carved map table bore scars from decades of plans and wars, its lines deepened by countless hands. Heavy banners sagged against old stone walls, their gold threads dulled by time.

King Orestane stood leaning over the border lines, gaze fixed west.
“Zevaragrad’s eyes turned chasing ruin and smoke on their frontier,” he murmured. “And in doing so, they leave their eastern grip slackened.”

Cassimar, ever mild, as if remarking on tomorrow’s rain:
“If Prince Arlen bleeds his strength on roads that far, the river towns and high passes will lie near unguarded.”

Kaelen stepped closer, boots whispering on worn flagstone. His hand settled on the carved wood, thumb resting near Zevaragrad's crest, thumb resting on the carved wood, thumb resting near Zevaragrad's crest. Voice tight with purpose, eager despite caution:
"Then we should press west. Take what no one watches -- a few towns, an old holdfast, perhaps even a fortress. Land no one names... until it's gone.

Oretane's gaze sharpened, something cold and pleased flickering there.
"Exactly. Let them discover absence too late to fill it."

Cassimar inclined his head, words ever practical:
"They may protest when strength returns -- but for a time, they'd have none to throw us out."

Kaelen's eyes lingered on the Zevaragrad crest, thumb tracing it's edge. His tone shifted, not softer, but shaded by something unspoken.
"And what of Elaria? She's still there."

Orestane's stare caught his son's meaning, weighing the question behind the words.
"She grew up beside you, yes. But blood often remembers where crowns sit."

Kaelen's jaw tightened, stubborn warmth threading through steel:
"She was nearly family, once."

Cassimar’s eyes flick up at that — the faintest tightening around the mouth; gone as quick as it comes.

A pause stretched between them. Orestane's voice dropped lower, roughened by thought:
"If she returns, perhaps she shouldn't remain only a councillor's daughter."

Kaelen lifted his gaze, hope glinting under measured calm.
"You'd have her wed?"

"One bond to draw Orelia's name closer to Zevarian blood," Orestane said.
"And you know her heart better than most."

Cassimar folded his hands, voice quiet, steady:
"If their empire fractures, she may already nearer the winning branch than any Zevarian lord."

Kaelen's thumb kept circling the map's border; voice flat but asking:
"And if she doesn't come back?"

Orestane's reply was quiet steel.
"Then she was never ours to claim."

For a heartbeat, Cassimar’s gaze fixes on the map — unreadable, but something shadows his expression before duty shutters it away.

The hush that followed held old banners, dust, and the weight of names -- none of them saying aloud what it would cost to lose her, or win her.

*** 

The sun slants in through tall arched windows, painting dusty gold across the mosaic floor. A half-fallen banner hangs overhead, it's faded crest stirring down when the breeze sneaks in. Outside, the hum of the keep carries on: distant hammer on anvil, training swords clashing.

But here in the, it feels as if time holds it's breath.

Torren stands near a carved pillar, hands clasped behind his back. He looks up as Eran approaches, trying for a smile that never quite reaches his eyes.

"I wanted to tell you first," Torren begins voice low. "Father's sending me north-east. Thalenor -- the city of scrolls."

Eran stops short, surprise teasing quickly to something that feels like betrayal, though he knows it isn't fair.

"First Arlen rides west... now you're off to count dusty scrolls?"

Torren's chuckle is gentle, but there's a strain at the corners of his mouth.
"Better me than you. And it won't be forever."

"How long?" Eran presses, though he already knows the answer.

"Years, maybe" Torren admits. "Until they think I'm learned enough to be useful."

Eran's voice dips softer, almost small:
"Who'll I bother then?"

"You'll manage," Torren says, warmth breaking through for a moment. "And when I'm back, you'll be taller than me. Maybe even wiser."

They step closer; Eran's hand curls briefly into the cloth at Torren's sleeve.
The hug they share is quick, almost embarrassed -- but fierce. Torren's hand stays on Eran's shoulder a heartbeat longer before letting go.

Across the gallery, on the far side of the courtyard, Julian slows his stride. Cloak whispering over worn stone, he looks through the arches and sees his two brothers caught between youth and duty. For a breath, something softens in his eyes -- memory, maybe, or regret. But it hardens quickly as it comes; he turns away, footsteps fading into the hush of the colonnade.

The breeze stirs the hanging banner; dust motes dance in a single shaft of light.

Eran forces a crooked grin, voice trying for teasing but landing closer to pleading:
"Just don't stay so long you forget the way home."

Torren's answering smile is tired but certain:
"Even if it takes years, Eran... I won't forget."

Eran watches him go, the sound of boots fading down the stone hall. The gallery, once full of sun and voices, feels wider now -- and emptier.

***

Fire flickers low; sherbet untouched on the table; embroidery half-finished in each lap. Shadows stretch long across stone, stirring faintly with each sigh.

Victoria, voice tight, gaze locked on the dark window:
"It's been weeks. No letter, no rider -- not even a rumour. Fredrick too -- it isn't like him."

Julia tries for calm, though the worry still sits under her words:
"Arlen's never written much, even when he was just across the river."

She glances around the circle, her needle stilled between two stitches:
"But he'd at least send word. Especially now, with Elaria here."

Leyla, mild and curious, shifts in her chair:
"Do you truly think there's something? He's barely spoken of her."

Victoria hesitates, then let's honesty win:
"He doesn't know how to speak. You saw it -- the way his voice softened when he asked of her. And the way she looked back."

Julia, voice softer still:
"Even if it's only the start of a start... it's there. And she is half Zevarian by blood."

Maria, the eldest, keeps her gaze lowered to her lap, thumb raising over the edge of her embroidery hoop:
"Blood counts less than memory. She was raised in Cassimar's court. That shadow doesn't lift easily."

Victoria lifts her chin, quiet steel behind it:
"Yet Arlen's stubborn. If he's chosen to see past that, what can words do?"

Maria's sigh is heavier than words alone:
"It isn't words I fear. It's what waits on the road -- blades don't care whose heart is softer."

The room drifts quiet; the only sound the fire settling in the grate.

Maria speaks again, voice lower:

"Soon I'll have to ride back east. Dawngard can't spare me longer."

Lelya, barely above a whisper:
"Then stay until word comes. One letter, at least."

Maria, looking down at the cooling sherbet: 
"And if it doesn't?"

Silence gathers, brittle as spun glass.

A rustle of skirts at the threshold.

Veyra steps in -- streaks of grey threaded through hair catching the firelight, presence calm but edged with same worry that sits in all their chests.

She doesn't scold, only sets a gentle hand on the back of Maria's chair:
"Blades rarely care, true... but hearts do. And it's hearts that call men home."

She rests a cup by Maria's elbow, still warm, untouched so far.
"Pray, yes" Veyra adds softly, gaze passing over each daughter, "but, don't let waiting steal your strength."

They fall quiet, drawing small comfort from the weight of her presence.

Beyond the window, night presses in close; no hoofbeats come, and no letter arrives.

***

The wind rustles the heavy curtains; oil lamps gutter, throwing shadows across unfinished embroidery and cooling sherbet left untouched.

Senara stands by the tall window, glancing back as Elaria enters, cloak still faintly dusted from the corridor.

Senara, voice calm but edged with something softer:
"Word will have reached home by now -- what you sent about the west."

Elaria keeps her tone measured, gaze fixed on nothing in particular:
"It was my duty. Nothing more."

A beat of quiet; Senara watches her, head tilted slightly, seeing more than Elaria says.

Then, lower:
"But it isn't nothing, is it? You and the prince... I've seen how you look when you think no one sees."

Elaria's mouth lightens; she meets Senara's eyes, voice steady but brittle:
"Then see this too: I know what house I came from. And so does he."

Senara, words gentle but pointed:
"Does it matter so much? Blood on a banner isn't always the same as blood in a heart."

Elaria's reply is quieter, but holds:
"It should matter. And it does."

The hush between them deepens, broken only by the wind tugging at the curtains. Senara steps closer, voice softer still:
"Even if you rather it didn't -- it shows on your face, Elaria."

Elaria draws a slow breath, letting it out as little more than a sigh:
"Then let's hope it shows on no one else's."

Far below, bells toll the hour; the sound drifts through stone walls. A knock the door breaks the hush.

The chamberlain's voice carries in, muffled:
"Lady Elaria -- his Majesty asks for you."

Senara meets her gaze, searching then lets it go.
Elaria squares her shoulders, gathering her cloak, and turns to leave.

The walk to the king's solar feels longer than it should. Shadows stretch along the hall; the scent of smoke and old wax hangs heavy.

At the door, the chamberlain bows low.
"My king, Lady Elaria."

Theron looks up from a scatter of letters and maps, the fire behind him throwing deep lines across his face.

"Come in, child. Sit."

Elaria steps forward, dips a small bow, and takes the chair he gestures to.

Theron’s gaze rests on her, thoughtful lines deepening at the corners of his eyes.
 “And what of your duty here, Elaria? Weeks pass, and still you remain.”


She holds the mask firm, though Senara’s words still echo under her ribs.
 “Treaties take longer than ink, my king. Each lord wants his clause in writing, each steward quarrels over taxes on the grain roads… and they have long memories — of whose daughter I am.”



A pause. Her voice drops, quieter, almost reluctant:
“So I stay. To remind them I stand for Zevaragrad now, not Cassimar’s court.”

Theron studies her, the firelight catching silver in his beard — approval, pity, or calculation; hard to say.

They speak next of duty: the slow unrest brewing out west, riders sighted too close to the old watchtowers, rumors of hidden camps along the border roads. Whether Orelia might move before winter closes the mountain passes.

Theron's voice is low, measured; Elaria answers carefully, each word weighed. Outside, unseen, dusk settles over slate roofs.

A small silence grows between them. Theron leans back, eyes drifting, and catches on the locket at her throat -- a piece she's always worn.

His voice, lower now, tinged with memory:
"That locket... it was your mother's, wasn't it?"

Elaria nods, a touch wary:
"Yes. She had it as long a I can remember."

Theron's gaze turns inward, to years neither of them saw:
"Did you know she was my cousin?

Shock flashes through her eyes -- sharp, raw, as if a hidden seam inside her life has split open.
For a heartbeat, the mask she wears every day slips, and the room feels too small to hold what she's just learned.
"No... truly?"

Theron nods, the fire painting old scars in shadow across his face. Theron’s gaze lingers on the locket at her throat; his voice drops, roughened by memory:

 “When the Crimson Sea War broke out, I thought your mother had died with the others in the Isles. But it seems she was taken — made a hostage when they stormed the Eastern Isles. Cassimar wed her soon after.”

He pauses, studying the delicate metalwork, something tightening behind his eyes:

 “When you first came to court and gave your mother’s name… I wondered, just faintly. But seeing that locket tonight — I know. It was made by our grandmother, given to Miraya’s mother, and then to Miraya herself. There’s no mistaking it.”

His voice softens, almost to himself:

 “I remember her wearing it, even as a girl. She never took it off.”

For a moment, all the careful mask falls away. Shock flares, raw and unguarded — as though a stone she’d always stood on had been kicked out from under her. The locket at her throat feels suddenly heavier; a name she’d worn all her life shifts, meaning something new.

She lowers her eyes to the locket, thumb brushing it's edge:
"She died when I was little. I hardly remember her face."

"She was kind," Theron says quietly. "Braver than most gave her credit for."

Another hush, longer now -- broken only by the hiss of the hearth and the dull clang of an iron bell in the city below.

They speak a little more -- of old campaigns and broken pacts, of what blood binds... and what it cannot.

Finally Elaria rises, cloak catching the lamplight in it's fold. She bows her head -- not just in courtesy, but with a gravity that holds the weight of what was spoken.

Theron watches her go, gaze lingering on the locket one last time. The door closes softly behind her, and the hall outside swallows the sound.

For a breath, the chamber holds its silence — filled only by the crackle of the hearth and the long shadows on carved stone.
Outside, night settles over Zevaragrad, indifferent to old blood and new truths alike.
