# Chapter 11 (The eyes of war)

**Four days later... Snowtide 12th day, 1701 AC**


The air was cool enough to make each breath a little cloud. Pale light spilled over the courtyard walls, stretching the shadows of the archery targets across the stone. Eran stood at the line, feet set, bowstring drawn back to his cheek. The arrow sang when he loosed it. A moment later, the dull thock of stone meeting wood. Almost dead centre.

Elaria slowed as she passed the edge of the ground, her steps catching in the dust. She had been on her way back from the library, but the rhythm of arrows and the boy's ready stance pulled her attention.

"You don't miss often," she called after his next shot.

He glanced over his shoulder, a quick, almost bashful smile tugging at his mouth.
"Only when someone's watching."

She stepped onto the range, hands clasped loosely behind her back. "Mind if I join you?"

Eran shrugged with mock seriousness. "If you're ready to lose."

They took turns, arrows whispering past the fletching as they flew. Elaria was better than most soldiers she'd met at the Eastern Isles -- though she didn't say so -- but Eran was quicker -- more precise. His arrow split the feather of one of hers already lodged in the target.

He grinned. "Beginner's luck for me, I suppose."

As she took an arrow from the quiver between them, their hands briefly touched -- just a quick casual exchange. Eran kept his eyes on the target.

After the last round, they leaned against the low railing, catching their breath.
"How long have you been training?" she asked.

Eran wiped a fleck of dust from his knuckles. 
"Since I could life the bow. Father wanted me to learn the sword first... But I wanted the bow."
His gaze softened. "When I'm older, I'll ride with Arlen. Not just as his brother -- as a soldier, one that the world is yet to see."

Elaria studied him in the quiet that followed. There was no doubt in his voice. No politics. Just loyalty.

He straightened, shouldering his bow. "Next time. I'll go easy on you."

She gave him a small smile. "We'll see."

Eran jogged towards the steps, his figure disappearing between the columns.

Elaria stayed where she was, looking after him for a moment. Then her eyes drifted toward the spires of the keep. The smile faded to something smaller, more complicated, before she turned away.

The yard was alive with low murmurs and the crackles of fires burning in scattered braziers. Soldiers moved through the shadows, their faces drawn and dirt-streaked as they checked weapons and prepared for days ahead under the fading light.

Arlen stood apart from the hustle, the weight of recent losses hanging heavily upon him.

Fredrick approached him, breaking the silence:
"How're you holding up, Arlen?"

Arlen didn't hide behind false courage. His gaze was distant, haunted. "They followed me here to the west. Half of them now lie beneath the ground. I can't let that stand".

Fredrick nodded, understanding the guilt at his friend's chest.

Arlen's jaw tightened. "Reinforcements alone won't fix this. The real problem is we don't know the ground. I've never seen the Serpent's Nest. We were almost cut down just getting here. I won't walk blind into another trap."

Fred's eyes narrowed. "We need to catch one of those Smoke Riders. Break them, turn them."

Arlen's hope flickered. "If the scouts find a trail soon, we'll have a chance. If not... we'll have to draw them out ourselves."

The wind shifted, carrying smoke from the fires into the darkening sky. Fred's voice was steady, firm. "We'll get them, Arlen. One way or another."

Arlen nodded, silence settling over them. The battlefield wasn't just out there -- it was inside him now.

He looked toward the horizon, the flames castling flickering shadows. "I'm done reacting. Next time... we strike first " Arlen paused for a moment, like something clicked in his mind, he clasped Fredrick's shoulders, "Wait... I think I know how we can beat them, the Smoke Riders." Fredrick nodded, "Yeah? How?". Arlen in a hurry, "Come let's talk to Miron about this...". 

Both of them rush towards the war room.
***

The war room was dimly lit by flickering oil lamps, the heavy scent of wax and old parchment thick in the air. Maps sprawled across the large wooden table, edges curled from use. Around it, a handful of tired commanders stood -- one nursing a cheek, one coughing quietly. The tension in the room was a low hum, but beneath it was the unmistakable stir of action resuming.

Arlen and Fredrick stepped inside, their faces still marked by recent wounds but their posture sharper, more focused. Miron was already present, bent over reports and briefing an officer, his quill scratching briskly. The commanders looked up as Arlen approached the table.

Without preamble, Arlen's voice cut through the quiet. "We can't afford to wait for reinforcements from Zevaragrad. How far is the nearest military post?"

Fredrick chimed in. "Aleskar. That's where we passed through coming here from the capital."

Arlen's eyes narrowed. "They'd arrive a week late."

Miron nodded, glancing at the map.
"There's an alternative -- Caelmoor, about twenty miles southeast."

Arlen's gaze sharpened. "How many men?"

"Roughly thirty thousand, mostly seasoned infantry and cavalry," Miron replied.

"Send a rider immediately, or a pigeon," Arlen said, tapping the table. "Tell them I want two thousand here within the next two days. No delays."

Miron nodded, marking the orders on the map.

Arlen turned to another point. "What about the Varacian Guard posts scattered around and from this fort?"

Miron's face tightened. "The elite scouts? We could pull together five hundred if we move fast. But I'd mobilizing from three different outposts."

Arlen agreed. "Do you have any here?"

"About two hundred, ready."

Arlen considered if briefly and nodded.
"Good. We'll need them."

One of the commanders showed concern over the possibility of those soldiers also being ambushes by the smoke riders.

Commander Halvek leaned forward.
"We took the southern hills, coming here from the Capital" he said.
"Faster and safer."

Arlen's finger traced a path on the map.
"That's the route. Have Caelmoor reinforcements come through here -- but double the scouts there and patrol the area. I won't risk another ambush."

He looked up. "I want the scouts tripled. Eyes in trees. Any flicker of smoke, any rider out of place -- you let me know immediately."

The room fell silent except for the soft crackle of the lamps. Arlen's finger rested on the marked area labeled the Serpent's Nest, the infamous enemy stronghold within the Zevarian lands.

"We lost the element of surprise," he said quietly. "Next time, we hit them first."

Fredrick leaned in, voice low. "How do you plan to do that?"

Arlen met his gaze. "We don't truly know the Serpent's Nest. We have to understand it -- find passages, weak points. The only was is to send a small team inside."

Fredrick frowned. "You mean infiltrate their base?"

Arlen nodded. "Me, you, and a handful of soldiers -- a little more than half a dozen. We'll spend a couple of weeks there, gather intel about the base, the surrounding terrain. Then we come back with a plan."

Miron in a concerned tone. "But you're the Prince. We can't just send you into the enemy's throat".

Arlen lightly punches his fists on the table, "If I'm gonna lead an attack on the enemy's base, I better see it myself, what is there waiting for us."

Arlen straightens. "We'll leave a few men behind, ready to move when the time comes."

Miron and Fredrick exchanged looks and gave their nods.

"We have to be cautious," Arlen continued.
"Some of them have seen us before -- at the ambush. Showing our faces would be suicide."

He turned to Miron. "Do we have Flaming pitch and grey-fire?"

Miron replied, "Yes, but not in large amounts. Limited supplies."

Arlen's lips curled into a tight smile. "Okay now listen..."

His voice lowered as he began outlining the finer points, the plans that would decide their next move -- but the details remained unheard, hanging in the flickering light.

The Smoke Riders returned to camp at dusk, their mounts laden with spoils of a burned village. Crates and sacks of stolen goods swayed beneath the weight. No prisoners accompanied them -- only the quiet aftermath of destruction and restless murmurs of riders riding back to the base.

Near the centre of the camp, the ember tent flickered with firelight. Inside, Ivar, the leader, sat cross-legged on a worn rug, his gaze steady as his closest lieutenants gathered around. The smoke-filled air was thick with tension, shadows dancing across their grim faces.

"We've heard the whispers," Ivar began, voice low but commanding. "The prince... it appears that he survived the ambush."

A murmur spread across the lieutenants. One, a tall rider with a jagged scar across his cheek, spat onto the ground. "Then our work isn't done. He can be the true threat -- not any blade or soldier. If he regroups, our advantage slips."

Ivar nodded slowly. "Exactly. The Prince's survival changes everything. We can't rush recklessly, but we can't wait either. We strike when they least expect it."

Another lieutenant, younger and restless, leaned forward. "They've lost men. We need to take swift action. Drag this war to their doorstep before they find strength again."

Ivar's eyes narrowed. "Patience is a weapon, as sharp as an arrow. A reckless attack will leave us vulnerable. We watch, wait... and then we strike hard and fast."

He paused, glancing toward the tent's entrance where scouts slipped in from the shadows. "Speaking of watching... I'm sending out more scouts. They'll patrol the passages around the Serpent's Nest entrance and the area near the Greywatch -- look for everypath The Prince could use to call reinforcements."

A seasoned lieutenant crossed his arms. 
"Silent and quick. Mark the trails, observe their patrols. We need eyes everywhere."

"Exactly," Ivar agreed. "No slip-ups. Secrecy is our shield."

The camp beyond the tent was quiet now, but Ivar knew the storm was gathering. His gaze fixed on the flickering flames. "The Prince may have survived, but this war is far from over. We hold our ground, gather our strength -- and when the time comes we remind them why the Smoke Riders was feared."

A heavy silence settled over the group. The weight of the coming battle pressed down like the smoke curling through the air.

Outside, the forest stood watchful and still.
