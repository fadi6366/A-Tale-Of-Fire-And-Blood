# Chapter 10 (When the smoke clears)

**Two days later...**

The canvas overhead was stained with light -- yellowed and thin, trembling with every gust outside. Arlen blinked. The sharp scent of blood and herbs clung to the air. Beneath him, rough bedding. A tight bandage wrapped around his ribs like a vice.

He drew a breath. Regretted it instantly.

Pain lanced through his chest, hot and jagged. His hand twitched toward it, but the movement tugged at stitches. He gritted his teeth, forcing the groan down.

"I'm alive," he murmured hoarsely. The words tasted strange -- like they belonged to someone else.

A figure shifted beside him. Fredrick. Half-sitting on the next bed, propped by pillows, eyes dark-circled but alert. His arm was bound in linen, his tunic still stained. He looked like he'd aged a decade.

"Barely," Fredrick rasped. "You always had a flair for the dramatic."

Arlen almost laughed. His chest wouldn't let him.

"You look like a scarecrow that picked the wrong field." Arlen said, voice rough.

Fredrick gave a crooked grin. "Takes one to know one."

Both shared a chuckle.

Silence stretched, broken only by distant shouting outside -- orders, hooves, the clatter of armour. The world still turned.

A young medic stepped inside, arms full of loaded cloth. Barely older than fifteen, his hands paused mid-task when he saw Arlen awake.

"My prince," the boy asked, startled. "You're... awake. Should you be--?"

He trailed off.

"I'm sitting. Not leading a charge," Arlen said.

"Tell me... how many made it back?"

The boy hesitated, lowering the cloth.

"Two columns arrived untouched," he said.

"The one through the woods, and the one along the southern plains. Orvek and Yours..."

He trailed off.

Arlen already knew.

"How many??"

"Ten," the boy said quietly. "You and Lord Fredrick. Eight others. Out of five hundred."

Arlen stared at him. The boy looked like he wanted to shrink through the floor.

"They fell on us near dawn", Arlen said, almost to himself. "They knew the road. The timing... the numbers..."

"Smoke riders," the boy said. "That's what the scouts are calling them."

"What about the other column?" Arlen asked.

"Orvek's."

The boy's mouth tightened. He didn't speak for a moment.

"They found pieces of it," he said at last.

"Scattered along the ruins. No survivors."

Fredrick looked away. Arlen closed his eyes.

"Orvek?" he asked.

"Didn't make it."

The words landed like stones. Arlen felt the weight of them settle deep, heavier than any sound.

He'd argued with Orvek before they left the capital. About the formation, the patrols. He remembered the captain's scowl.

And now he was gone.

"Leave us," Arlen said.

The boy bowed quickly and ducked out.

For a long moment, neither Arlen nor Fredrick spoke.

Fredrick broke the silence first.

"Last thing I remember is your voice. Then everything went red."

Arlen didn't look at him.

"I didn't do anything," he said. "We were already breaking when I shouted. Horses were fleeing, men were screaming -- no one else was listening."

He swallowed hard.

"They got out because they weren't finished by the smoke riders like us. Not because of me."

His voice was flat.

Fredrick brow tightened, but he didn't argue.

"Still. You stood your ground, Arlen."

"But still I couldn't save anyone, got them killed anyway. Half of the men I brought." Arlen muttered.

Silence.

Fredrick finally said,

"We were ambushed by something we didn't know about, terrain stranger to us. Even Orvek ---"

He trailed off.

"He didn't make it either."

Arlen closed his eyes.

"I should've known. Should've seen it coming.

This is on me."

"A thousand men, Fred. Gone."

Fredrick didn't try to console him.

Just leaned back, jaw set.

Outside, the sounds of the fort crept in -- orders barked, iron scraping wood, a fire being stoked back to life.

Inside, the medic room was dim and cold. Smoke from the hearth hurled in the corners. The stench of blood clung to the stone.

Arlen sat still, back against the wall, the wool blanket slipping from his shoulders.

He had breath in his lungs. But that wasn't the same as winning.

Fredrick didn't speak. He just sat on the bed next to Arlen's, quiet, the silence thick between them.

***

The training yard was quiet at first light. Miron stood near the fort wall, arms crossed, watching the men cycle through broken drills. Blades clashed in tired rythym. It was a hollow echo of the imperial host, a skeletal on scorched ground. He watched them, his thoughts a knot of fury. They should have been more cautious. They should have known. They had taken the enemy for granted, a sin of arrogance.

A boy in a leather jerkin ran up, breathless.

"Captain. The prince is awake."

Miron gave a nod. He didn't hurry. Just turned and walked toward the medic room.

The room was colder than he expected. Damp stone, the stink of rot and herbs. Arlen was upright against the wall, bandaged and pale, but awake. Alert.

"You look like a man who's seen the edge," Miron said, dragging a stool beside the bed.

Arlen gave a dry exhale. "It's uglier that I thought."

They sat a while in silence, the fire snapping low in hearth.

"I messed up," Arlen said at last.

"I thought that splitting up the men will reduce the change of alerting the enemy, instead it made us vulnerable."

Miron didn't answer right away. Just watched him.

"You weren't the only one to make the call," he said finally. "But you're the one who lived through it."

Arlen jaw tightened. "Orvek didn't."

Fredrick speaks from the bed next to Arlen.

"You know, you don't have to blame yourself for everything."

Arlen shifts his gaze towards Fredrick.

"But I made a wrong move here, Fred. If we'd marched as one maybe lesser men would've lost their lives in an ambush like this," he paused for a moment then continued, "Maybe we'd loose three or four hundred but we've lost a thousand and that is on me." 

The silence stretched again.

Then Miron leaned forward, voice level but direct.

"What do you mean to do next, my prince?"

Arlen's gaze drifted towards the hearth. Fire lighting up the room.

When he looked back, his face was worn but clear.

"I don't care what they are. I don't care how fast they ride. I'm not leaving this place until I make them pay for every name we lost."

Miron studied him for a moment.

Then nodded once.

"I'll see to the men."

Miron stood, his hand resting briefly on Arlen's shoulder before he turned. The door shut behind him as walked out, in the cold light of morning.

Arlen didn't move. He just stared at the hearth, jaw tight, the weight of a hundred choices pressing down like stone.

The silence returned -- sharp, steady, and unforgiving.

***

Steel rang against steel in the practice yard. Darius drove his blade, hammering into Julian's guard. Both men were slick with sweat, breath sharp, feet shifting across the worn stone ground.

Nearby, Eran loosed an arrow. It struck slightly wide of the mark. He muttered under his breath and nocked another.

A shuffle of hurried footsteps broke the rhythm. Julian glanced toward the colonnade -- his eyes narrowed. A man in grey-and-white livery of the pigeon roost was darting across the courtyard, clutching a sealed parchment tight to his chest.

Julian lowered his blade.

"You there -- what's happened?"

The pigeon master skidded to a stop, breathless.

"Word from the western marches, Your Majesty. It's urgent. For the king."

He bowed slightly, then continued his rush toward the high galleries.

Darius frowned. Eran had already abandoned his bow, trailing after the man. Julian exchanged a quick look with his elder brother before following.

Inside the royal solar, sunlight slanted through high windows. Queen Veyra sat on a cushioned bench, embroidery forgotten in her lap. Theron stood at the windows, arms crossed behind his back. Elaria was nearby in the gallery outside the solar conversion in low tones with Senara. Both of them heading outside for some fresh air -- but their conversation stilled at the first echo of footsteps.

From the far gallery, Elaria caught sight of the pigeon master approaching. His pace, the way he clutched the scroll -- something in it turned her blood colder. Without waiting for invitation, she moved toward the solar. Senara hesitated a second, then followed.

The master entered, bowed low, and handed the scroll to the king.

"Direct from the fort, sent by Miron. Your Majesty."

Theron broke the seal.

By then, the three princes had reached the doorway -- Eran first, face tight with unease.

"What is it?" he asked. "What does it say? Is it Arlen?" worry in his tone.

Theron didn't speak for a moment. His eyes scanned the lines, jaw locked, unreadable.

Then, flatly:

"Two of the columns sent west, almost a thousand men, gone."

Veyra's hand froze on her thread.

"Gone? What do you mean gone?"

Eran stepped forward.

Theron continued, voice clipped.

"They were ambushed. Just a few miles short of the fort. Commander Orvek dead. Few survivors."

Julian exhaled sharply, Darius said nothing, only folded his arms.

"And Arlen?" Veyra asked, her voice barely a whisper.

Theron's gaze lingered a second layer on the parchment.

"Wounded. But alive. His friend, Fredrick as well, barely survived. They are at the Fort now, with Captain Miron."

A soft breath escaped the queen, and she sat back, shoulders slumping in quiet relief.

Beyond the threshold, Elaria stood still. Her face didn't move, but Senara saw her fingers curl slightly at her sides. A breath, subtle and shaky, escaped her lips.

Eran's voice cracked.

"We have to send them aid. Men. Supplies -- whatever they need."

Darius cut him off.

"We've already lost two columns. You'd throw more men into the fire?"

"He's our brother," Eran snapped. "He nearly died."

"And he'll die proper if you send another force out blind," Darius shot back. "He split his force and foolishly walked into an ambush."

Julian stepped between them.

"Enough. We wait. We asses. Charging west again won't bring back the dead."

Theron's voice cut through all of them.

"I will decide what's next."

The room fell silent. Only the sound of wind outside stirred the heavy curtains.

Then Veyra spoke, her voice steadier now.

"He's alive. That's what matters."

Theron looked out toward the horizon.

"For now".

***

Near the Dawngard border, southern side of Zevaragrad.

The wind whistled through the towers of the Valdrek estate -- a stone keep built for war as much as lineage. Dusk stretched long across the hills, firelight flickering in the great hall.

A courier arrived at the gates without fanfare. Jason met him, took the sealed letter, broke it open with a finger that already knew dread. He read in silence, then passed it to his father.

William Valdrek read aloud, voice low and even:

"...Ambushed west of the Marches. Two columns lost. Orvek dead. Prince Arlen lives. Fredrick among the survivors."

"Ten men returned."

A beat of silence. The fire cracked.

Olivia Valdrek rose from her chair, lips drawn tight.

"He followed that boy into war. For what? A prince's pride?"

Her hands trembled, but she crossed her arms, jaw set. Fury stood in for fear.

William didn't flinch.

"He followed Arlen because he chose to. Because honour still means something."

He folded the letter once.

"Fredrick's no child. And neither is Arlen. You raise men like that, you don't to hold them back."

Jason looked between them.

"Fred said Arlen would walk through fire for him. So he'd do the same."

William nodded faintly.

"He always saw Arlen like a younger brother. And the prince? Feels the same."

Olivia scoffed.

"One day he'll die for that boy. Or for that Zevaran Princess he's fall in love with."

No one answered. Not right away.

William finally said, more gently:

"A man doesn't always follow orders. Sometimes he follows his heart."

Jason turned toward the hearth, watching the flames.

"Then let's hope the prince is worth it."

William's voice came quiet, certain:

"I trust my son, Fredrick. That's enough."

Rain began to tap against the windows.

Olivia's eyes flicked to a high shelf -- a wooden sword, chipped and faded, once Fredrick's favourite. She said nothing more.

The fire hissed as the logs shifted. The three of them sat there in the quiet -- together, but not close -- each alone in what they feared.

***

Victoria stood alone in the gallery, half-shadowed by the stained glass. She hadn't moved since the news broke.

Leyla approached quietly. "You heard?"

Victoria gave a small nod. Her eyes didn't leave the far horizon.

"When I heard there was an ambush... I thought I'd never see him again."

Her voice was soft, almost a whisper -- not broken, but close.

"At least he's alive, that's all what matters now, right?"

Leyla said, putting a hand on Victoria's shoulder.

Victoria nodded.

A breeze stirred the silk drapes. Somewhere in the distance, the bells of the city tolled the hour -- calm, uncaring.

 ***

The wind blew sharp and bitter over the fort, carrying the cold of open plains. Arlen stood on the roof leaning on the stone, his breath fogging in the night air, ribs aching beneath tight bandages. Every bruise reminded him of what he'd cost them.

Two columns gone. Hundreds dead. Orvek -- gone.

_We should've marched as one. Maybe we'd loose less men._

He'd gambled and lost. They all paid the price.

His fingers gripped on the edge of the parapet. The ache wasn't just in his body. It was the weight of command, of choices made wrong.

And then, Elaria came to his mind. Her voice, her stubbornness, the way she'd look at him when they met. She had a way of looking at him like he was something more than blood and duty.

Fred had warned him. Told him to be careful.

_What if Fred's right?_

Not because she was dangerous -- but because she was starting to matter. Maybe more than she should.

His eyes drifted east, where the sky hung darker over the distant lands. Home. Zevaragrad. Her.

He exhaled, slow. Regret simmering, anger quiet beneath it.

"I'll see this ended," he murmured.

Far away beneath the same moon, Elaria stood cloaked against the chill, the marble balcony cold under her feet. The city stretched below -- rooftops sleeping under silver light, towers quiet, the bells tolling midnight from the cold tower.

She hadn't meant to stop here. Just passing through, she told herself. But her steps had brought her to this spot.

The letter had reached them just hours ago. Arlen was alive. Barely. Fredrick too.

She should've felt relief. She did -- but it came tangled with guilt.

It was her message, weeks ago, that tipped off the western movement. Her job had been simple: monitor Zevaria's tensions, send word to Orelia.

And now he'd almost died.

And now... she wasn't sure.

Theron had told her something else, something probably no one else knew -- her mother's blood was royal, once. Cousin to the king. Another reason to be useful. Another reason to be watched.

She pressed a hand to her chest, fingers brushing the edge of the locket she always wore.

Arlen might've started to trust her. Too much, maybe. She hadn't lied -- not completely.

But she hadn't told the truth either.

And still... when she'd heard his name, alive but wounded, something inside her twisted. The soft corner she'd buried beneath orders and oaths had started to crack a little wider.

She looked up at the moon -- pale, distant, impossibly whole -- and wondered how he was, and what he'd become on that blood-soaked plain.

Far to the west, on a wind-scoured parapet above the fort, Arlen leaned against the cold stone, bandages tight around his ribs. Breath misting in the chill, he lifts his gaze to the moon -- pale, watchful, untouched by blood or ash.

In Zevaragrad, Elaria stands in the balcony, same moonlight pooling at her. Her hand rests at her throat, fingers brushing the locket's edge.

Neither speaks. Miles of scorched fields and waiting armies lie between them -- but tonight, under that single silver eye in the sky, each thinks of the other.

The moon hangs silent, holding both their secrets.
