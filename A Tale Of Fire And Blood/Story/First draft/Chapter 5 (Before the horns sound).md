# Chapter 5 (Before the horns sound)

Evening settles over Zevaragrad.

The great hall glows under torchlight, violet-and-gold banners stirring in the rising warmth. At the long table, King Theron sits at the head, gaze unreadable; beside him, Queen Veyra, quiet in dark silks.

To Theron's left: Arlen, the heir — posture straight, though tension lingers at his shoulders. Beside him, restless Eran, eager eyes flicking about. Further down, Darius leans back, gaze cool and sharp; Julian watches the newcomers with a faint, amused curl to his mouth. Torren, still young but broader of shoulder than his age suggests, sits between them, soaking up every word.

Across the table: Victoria, Julia, Leyla and Maria in dresses catching the firelight’s sheen — deep crimsons and green velvets. At Maria’s insistence, two guests sit among them: Elaria and Senara, cloaks set aside, road dust washed away but weariness still shadowing their faces. Maria keeps near, her presence gentle but protective.

The hall murmurs with polite talk, cutlery on stoneware, goblets raised. Yet beneath every question floats something sharper — suspicion, curiosity.

Elaria feels it almost at once: Theron's steady stare, not openly hostile but weighing.
Darius watches too, gaze narrow. Julian reclines, head tilted, the faintest smirk playing on his lips, as though waiting for someone to slip.

Arlen’s gaze meets hers across the table more than once. Not cold — measured, curious, but quickly hidden behind formal reserve.

Senara’s voice is light beside her — talk of sea winds and sleepless nights — yet her shoulders remain stiff. She feels it too.

Maria steers the talk gently, asking about Dawngard’s harbor markets, or the wind on the crossing — her warmth a shield between guest and king.

At a pause, Arlen raises his head. His voice is polite, but his eyes rest on Elaria longer than courtesy demands.

 “The crossing from Dawngard can be rough this time of year. I hope the seas were kinder to you than they’ve been to our own ships.”

Elaria answers, calm despite so many eyes:

 “They showed their teeth, Your Highness. Salt-wet winds and sleepless nights... but we crossed whole.”

Arlen’s mouth twitches — almost a smile.

 “Then perhaps Zevaragrad feels tame by comparison.”

Veyra’s gaze sharpens. A mother’s instinct catches the flicker of interest between her son and the Orelian envoy. Julia watches too, brow raised; Victoria leans in subtly, weighing Elaria’s poise. Leyla hides a small, knowing smile behind her cup.

Silence stretches before Veyra speaks, voice low and deliberate:

 “Lady Elaria, if I may — tell us of your mother.”

Elaria’s hand stills on her goblet. Torchlight dances in her eyes.

“I remember little, Your Majesty. She died when I was a child. What stays with me are fragments — her voice in the garden at dusk, the scent of jasmine. The rest I know only through others’ words.”


Veyra’s gaze softens.

“I am sorry for your loss, child. Even faded memory leaves its mark.”


“Thank you, Your Majesty,” Elaria says quietly.


Across the table, Arlen’s expression shifts: a thoughtful look, quickly hidden.

At the name Miraya, Theron’s brows knit, recognition flickering across the iron mask of rule. Then, as though nothing had passed, his voice cuts through:

 “Your father, Cassimer — his health holds? These are restless times.”

Elaria meets his gaze, her answer measured:

 “He keeps council late into the night, but his resolve remains.”

Torren leans forward, voice less guarded:

“And your ports? I’ve heard Orelia’s harbors dwarf even Dawngard.”

Julian only watches, the faintest smile tugging at his mouth.

Then Eran, unable to hold his tongue, blurts:

“And the Eastern Isles? What are they truly like?”

Elaria tells of winds heavy with salt, ships crowding bustling docks. Senara adds, half-laughing, half-exhausted, about brine that clings to every meal. Laughter ripples around the table, softening the tension.

Yet Theron's voice cuts back in, quiet, carrying weight:

“I remember facing your father at the Crimson Sea. A worthy foe — though your empire took what had been ours.”

A hush follows.
Torren, eager to shift mood, recounts Arlen’s charge at the Red River; Eran joins in, voices quick and proud. Even Julian’s smirk eases. Darius remains stiff, gaze guarded.

Cups clink; talk dwindles to lower murmurs. Beneath it, old scars and unspoken questions stay alive, flickering in torchlight.

*** 

The dinner hall behind them, it's noise fading into hush.
Stone corridors breathed cool air, torchlight breaking into pools along polished marble.

Elaria and Senara walked side by side, cloaks trailing over the floor.
Their footsteps echoed, but softly -- as if the walls themselves were listening.

Senara broke the silence first, voice pitched low, teasing at the edge: 
"You barely took your eyes off him."

Elaria rolled her eyes, the motion small but real -- a flicker of tension cracking into a half-smile.
"I was watching the whole family," she said, voice calm but edged, as if that settled it.

Senara leaned in, glin sly beneath the torchlight.
"Especially the heir. Dark cloak, quiet eyes... Admit it, you're curious."

Elaria's tone sharpened, but it wasn't quite cold -- more like a blade sheathed halfway.
"Curious isn't weakness," she said, meeting Senara's gaze. "And it's not why we are here."

Senara's grin faded, softening into something thoughtful. "I know," she murmured. "But if he really is what the rumors say -- cold as the high passes, and ruthless when cornered -- better you see it than later."

They reached a narrow window cut deep into the stone wall, where torchlight spilled across the marble floor. Elaria paused there, gaze drifting past iron bars and the darkened courtyard below. For a moment, her reflection met her own eyes -- calm on the surface, but the thought pressed at the edges: she wasn't here to lose herself. She was here to weigh, to watch. Yet the line began to blur easier than she liked to admit.

Senara nudged her shoulder, a quiet firmness behind the gesture. "Don't worry," she said, voice low. "If you forget, I'll remind you why we crossed half a sea to get here."

Elaria let out a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding. The two of them turned down the corridor once more, steps echoing faintly in the quiet. Their shadows stretched out before them, long across the stone -- duty and doubt walking beside them in equal measure.

Their footsteps faded into quiet marble halls, torchlight painting restless shapes on stone.

From a shadowed archway, Maria stepped forward, cloak brushing the floor. Queen Veyra joined her, gaze fixed on the corridor where Elaria and Senara had vanished.

"You spent weeks on the road with her," Veyra said quietly, her voice edged with curiosity.
"What did you see?"

Maria's answer came after a breath: "She's careful, watchful. But... she noticed Arlen. And he noticed her. They watched each other more than either cared to admit."

Veyra's mouth curved, not quite a smile. "I saw it too. Two young birds circling, testing the wind."
Her gaze held a flicker of concern behind it's calm.
"Even a measured glance can grow into something harder to control."

Maria nodded. "She doesn't seem reckless. But it could mean trouble."

"Keep watch all the same," Veyra murmured, softer now. "Affection, curiosity -- whatever name it takes, it can bend loyalties faster than any blade."

For a heartbeat, neither spoke. Then the hush of the hall reclaimed them, and they turned away.

***

Pale morning light spills across the stone gallery, catching dust motes in quiet arcs. Elaria walks alone, steps unhurried, the hush of dawn still clinging to the high halls.

Bootsteps echo softly behind her. She turns; it's Arlen.
His cloak dark against the sunlit stone, hair slightly tousled from the walk. He doesn't smile, but there's no frost in his eyes either.

They stop, a few paces apart. For a breath, neither speaks.
"It's quieter here before the court wakes," he says, voice low, almost reflective.

"Quieter to think," Elaria answers, her gaze steady on this. "Or to see things without so many eyes."

A faint shift at the corner of his mouth -- not quite amusement, more like understanding.

"You watched us last night," he says, softer now, not accusing. "Not just me."

"And you watched me," she counters, a hint of warmth behind her words.

"Perhaps," Arlen concedes, the single word carrying more openness than denial.

They stand in silence, the distance between them feeling smaller than the length of the hall.

"The court is full of masks," Elaria says quietly. "Hard to know what matters and what's only for the show."

"Harder still," he replies, "to know which mask is your own."

Their gazes hold -- softer, almost gentle. A shared honestly neither planned.

"I suppose," she murmurs, "We'll see what's real in time".

"In time," Arlen echoes, voice low.

The faint call of trumpets breaks the stillness.
Duty waiting.

Without another word, they turn and walk toward the great doors -- side by side, not quite close, but not distant either.

And as they go: _Elaria wonders, just for a breath, whether the heir behind quiet eyes is colder or warmer than rumor claims._
_Arlen thinks -- perhaps too quickly, perhaps too late -- that the Orelian First Councillor's daughter see more than she says._

The thought lingers them both as the morning swallows their footsteps.

*** 

Zevaragrad's great hall felt colder then even winter should make it. Banners of violet and gold hung heavy above the assembled court, catching what the daylight managed to slip through the high arched windows.

On the Pheonix Throne, King Theron sat straight-backed, gaze fixed and unreadable. Beside him, Arlen kept his gesture formal, though his jaw was tight with quiet defiance. Darius crossed his arms, suspicion plain on his face; Julian leaned back, faint amusement curling his mouth. At the king's other side, Veyra watched an attentiveness that missed nothing.

Before them the Orelian envoy in dark green cloaks trimmed with silver thread, words chosen with care:
"A new century, Your Majesty -- a chance to mend what the Crimson Sea left torn. Lower tariffs, freer trade in luxuries. Orelian ships docking closer to Zevaragrad. Annual diplomatic exchanges..."

He paused, letting the hall's hush deepen, then offered the final piece:
"And for clarity and lasting peace, a commission to mark and map the disputed areas of the isles."

The words echoed off stone walls. A breath of quiet settled across the gathered courtiers.

Theron's gaze didn't waver. His answer, when it came, was measured steel:

"Trade, yes. Let words cross waters more than swords. Tariffs eased; envoys welcomed. But the Isles' borders were paid in blood. We will not redraw them to soothe fresh parchment."

A shift in the air-- some relief, some silent tension.

Theron then turned his gaze to where Elaria stood slightly behind Maria.
"And you father, Councillor's daughter? Does Cassimar truly support this Concord?"

Elaria inclined her head, voice steady though her pulse raced:
"He seeks peace, Your Majesty -- but peace does not mean forgetting where the lines we're first drawn."

The king studied her a breath longer, something like cautious respect flickering across his expression before it vanished. He signalled the session to end.

The envoy bowed, accepting the refusal that had always been likely. Courtiers began to disperse, silks whispering against marble floors. The great doors opened, pale light pooled across the stones.

All the while, Elaria's gaze met Arlen's across the hall-- brief moments, unspoken questions passing between them neither dared voice aloud.

As the court emptied, she stayed a moment, eyes lifting to the banner overhead: purple and gold, symbols of victories won long before her birth.

_A new century they say. But old games still rule the board. A I am a piece they placed, whether I wished it or not._

The hall slowly quietening, shadows reclaiming the marble. The game, for now, had moved to it's next turn.

***

Arlen stood barely shifted his weight near the dais when the doors cracked open after Theron signalled end of the court. A rider strode in, cloak streaked with road dust, sweat darkening the collar. The court's murmurs cut off at once.

The man dropped to one knee, voice hearse:
"Your Majesty... word from the Varacian Guard. Fort Graywatch, Western Marches."

Arlen felt it before it was spoken -- the faint coil of dread that came with any message from the border.

Theron broke the seal, reading quick and silent. A tightening of his jaw, barely there, told Arlen enough.

"Fires in the west," Theron said at last, voice calm, but edged. "Burned farms. Signs of Vargoth warbands pushing deeper than they've dared in years."

A rustle of uneasy movement swept the hall. Even the Orelian envoy leaned forward, catching every word.

Theron's gaze settled on his third-born.
"Arlen. In four nights, you ride west. Take men you trust. Find what truth lies behind this -- before it finds us."

Arlen bowed, words crisp, practiced:

"As you command."

Around them, whispers sparked. Julian's mouth quirked in wry amusement; Darius' expression hardened. And beyond them, near the columns, Arlen met Elaria's gaze: steady searching.

The hall felt colder in that moment, banners stirring in the high air.

Turning away, Arlen let the weight of command settle across his shoulders -- familiar, yet heavier this time. Four nights to ready, then westward into uncertainty.

The game had shifted. And this time, the next move was his.
