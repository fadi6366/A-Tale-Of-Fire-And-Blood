 Chapter 4 (Brothers in the half light)

Morning mist drifted across Vaelandar's stone courtyard, softening the worn flags underfoot. Somewhere beyond the walls, gulls called over the quiet harbour. Elaria stood alone, travel-tired yet watchful, the salt had stiffened the hem of her cloak; her hair stilled smelled faintly of brine and wind. Below, ships rocked against their moorings, sails furled tight against the damp breeze.

Footsteps approached. Maria -- graceful but without courtly stiffness -- crossed the courtyard toward her.

"You're the lady from the Eastern Isles?" Maria asked, her voice gentle, curious rather than prying. "The daughter of the First Councillor?"

They walked slowly across the courtyard together, skirts brushing the damp stone. The conversation stayed light at first -- scraps of weather, the length of the crossing, talk of the gulls wheeling above the towers.

"When I was a girl, I heard stories of Zevaran women taken after the war of the Crimson sea... some sold, some wed into new houses."

She glances sideways, curiosity slipping through the courtesy.

"Your mother -- she was from Zevaria too, wasn't she?"

Elaria nodded, voice quiet.

"She was. But she died when I was very young."

Maria's gaze softened, and they walked a few steps in silence before she spoke again:

"It must feel strange, coming here. To walk the stones your mother might have known... yet find them changed beyond her time -- and yours."

She touched the damp stone pillar wall tightly, as if weighing memory.

"My own marriage brought me East, and even now, there are corridors here that never quiet feel mine."

She turned to Elaria, voice gentle but curious:

"Do you carry much of her with you? A keepsake perhaps?"

Elaria pauses, fingers brushing the edge of her collar, then carefully draws out the necklace:

"Only this."

A slim gold pendant, oval in shape, etched with an old sunburst design — twelve narrow rays spreading outward, and at its heart, a single polished amber stone.

The gold is dulled by age, the engraving worn faint where fingers have traced it over the years.

Maria tilts her head, studying it:

 “It’s beautiful… and it looks old Zevaran work. Your mother’s?”

Elaria nods quietly:

 “All I have left of her.”

Maria’s gaze lingers on the sunburst, curiosity stirring but not pressing deeper.

“Then keep it close. Such things endure for a reason.”

Elaria nods with a smile.

A servant appears at the far end of the archway, head bowed, voice respectful:

"My lady, your chamber is ready."

Maria offers a faint, half-smile -- something between comfort and quiet caution.

"Rest well," she says, her tone softening.

"Dawngard is only your first step -- and these walls remember more than they show."

Elaria dips her head in thanks. For a heartbeat, she stands alone under the arch, cloak stirring gently in the sea breeze, the weight of duty settling on her shoulder once again.

**Five days later**.

As dawn breaks pale over Vaelandar’s towers, the envoy gathers at the gates — banners catching the light, carts loaded, riders tightening girths. The harbour mist curls along the cobbles. Horses stamp and toss their heads, breath steaming in the morning chill.

Elaria moves toward her horse, but Maria, already settled near a gilded carriage, leans out, voice gentle yet firm: “Ride with me awhile. The road’s long, and you’re no common envoy girl — your place is here.”

Senara swings into her saddle, throwing Elaria a small, unreadable glance.

After a moment’s hesitation, Elaria nods and climbs into the carriage beside Maria. Outside, the horns sound the march.

The envoy rolls out through Dawngard’s gates, wheels crunching on frost-bitten stones — the road ahead winding toward Zevaragrad, and the real test waiting beyond Dawngard’s walls.

***

**2.5 Months after the Battle of the Red River (Glacivar 1st day, 1701 AC)**

Early morning, pine forests east of Zevaragrad. Light cuts through in broken shafts; mist curls low among the moss and roots. The ground smells of wet needles and cold earth.

Theron rides ahead with Darius, the two speaking in low voices that don't carry. Behind them follow Arlen, Julian, and the younger boys -- Eran and Torren -- horses picking careful steps over roots and stones.

A handful of the Royal Guard ride a short distance to the flank and the rear -- armour muted under

hunting cloaks, spears upright, eyes scanning the treeline. Not quite a royal procession, but still a king's blood in the saddle, and caution never sleeps.

The ride starts quiet; breath fogs in the morning chill. Julian turns in the saddle, smirking back at Eran:

"Try not to shoot your own horse this time little lion."

Eran straightens, jaw set, trying to look older than his twelve years:

"My aim's better than yours, brother. Atleast I can draw without shaking."

Torren, younger still, muffles a laugh behind his glove; Arlen smiles faintly but keeps his gaze ahead.

The group slows, hooves soft on moss and fallen needles.

A flicker of movement ahead: a red deer slipping quick between the trunks, it's coat catching a shaft of pale light.

Eran leans forward, voice a hurried whisper:

"I'll take the shot."

Julian mutters, amused but careful not to spook it:

"Quiet, or you'll scare it off before you even draw."

Without waiting, Eran swings down from the saddle, bow already half-raised, breath shallow with excitement.

Arlen starts to dismount too -- ready to guide his little brother - but Theron lifts a hand, stopping him: "Let him try."

Eran runs lightly, bow steady despite youth; the deer startled and bolting.

He looses an arrow mid-run -- breath ragged steady uneven -- and the shot hits in the hindquarter.

The deer stumbles, bleeding Eran closes in, heart pounding, and finishes it with a second arrow at closer range.

For a moment, the clearing holds it's breath. Even the crows overhead fall silent, black wings still against the pale sky.

Then Theron urges his horse forward. The old king's face, usually carved from iron, softens by a fraction as leans down to rest a heavy hand on Eran's shoulder.

"Well struck," he says, voice low but carrying.

"You'll make a hunter yet".

Eran's chest rises and falls, breathless from the chase and the heat of triumph. His smile breaks through, quick and boyish, before he reins it back in.

Darius only gives a curt nod, his gaze cool — but there’s the faintest twitch at the corner of his mouth.

Julian, still sitting his horse with careless grace, lifts his brows. "Not bad, little lion," he drawls, the faintest edge of pride hidden under the teasing.

Even Darius, cold-eyed and watchful, inclines his head in a silent nod of approval.

A few steps back, Arlen watches his brother catch his breath. He remembers the same ache in his chest years ago — wanting to prove himself to a father who never said much. But darker hunts wait now: not stags in mist, but men in shadow.

They press deeper into the pines, the air sharpening with resin and damp moss. Sunlight breaks in restless shards between the branches, catching on mailed shoulders and the dark manes of their horses.

Arlen, Darius and Julian fan out a little, each with a bow resting lightly in hand. Ahead a brace of soldiers ride a respectful distance -- close enough to guard, for enough to leave the princes to their sport.

They flush out a scattering of pigeons from a fallen log. Julian looses first, his arrow, clipping feathers from a wing. Darius, silent and quick, brings down two more in an many heartbeats.

Arlen's shot finds a lean hare darting through the underbrush. The arrow buries deep; the animal topples and lies still.

They gather their small prizes -- pigeons, hares, nothing grand like Eran's deer, but enough to fill a saddle or two. The morning wears on, hooves stirring mud and leaf mold, breath misting in the cold air.

By noon, they turn back toward the keep, the scent of pine giving away the faint tang of woodsmoke on the wind. Prey tied to saddles, cloaks dusted with bark and broken twigs, they rode on, the forest falling away behind them — and somewhere beyond, trouble gathering like distant thunder.

***

A few days earlier, dusk crawled across the western marches of Zevaria, the sky bruised purple and ash. Smoke from distant bushfires mingled with the cold, and the outpost of the Varacian Guard stood half-sunk in shadow: rough-hewn pelisades, watchfires guttering low.

Hooves clattered on packed mud. Riders spilled into the yard, horses lathered with sweat, eyes wild from the road. Captain Miron stepped out to meet them, cloak thrown over one shoulder, the torchlight catching on the iron pins at his collar. His face was set, mouth hard as cold leather.

"What did you see?" he asked before the first scout could even catch breath.

The scout swallowed, voice ragged. "Foreign raiders, Captain. West of the Serpent's nest. We tracked them for two nights. Not just raiders -- moving in disciplined groups, flying crude banners. Burned two farmsteads clean. Hoofprints like nothing I've seen: heavy armoured mounts."

Captain Miron squinted into the dusk, the wind tugging at his cloak.

"They got this deep?" His voice was low, rough with disbelief. "How?... is the guard on the borders sleeping?"

One of the scouts, mud still crusted on his boots, shifted uneasily.

"Sir, it didn't happen all at once. Some came over months -- posing as trappers, charcoal burners, trading across from farm to farm. A few we're caught, but... more must've slipped through."

Miron's jaw tightened. "And the serpent's nest..."

"Yes," the scout said, glancing westward as though the trees themselves might be listening: "Even the patrols avoid it's heart. You already know it captain, marshland, fever, old ruins no one maps properly. They could camp there for weeks without a soul noticing -- move at night, strike and vanish again."

Miron felt a chill that had nothing to do with the dusk. If they’d truly rooted themselves in the Nest, it wasn’t just raids — it could open the marches to something far worse.

Miron spat into the dirt. "Too clever by half. And now they're dug in too deep to root out with a handful of men."

He turned, cloak shifting, to where the outpost courier waiting by the gate -- a lean man with road dust on his boots, reins clutched tight, horse steaming in the cold.

At his hip the rider carried a leather satchel, blank parchment rolled inside, ready for emergencies.

"Parchment, Now," Miron barked.

The rider tugged it free, stepping forward. At the same moment, a nearby sergeant -- broad shouldered, scar across his cheek -- unslung an inkboard and handed it over, head bowed.

Steam curled faintly from the ink in the dawn - chilled air.

Miron took the quill, writing fast, letters fast and hard:

>"_**To Zevaragrad, King Theron's own hand. Scouts report disciplined enemy riders west of the Serpent’s Nest — banners marked with the black wolf of Vargoth. Burned farmsteads, heavy mounts not seen in past raids. Signs point to infiltration over recent months; enemy likely entrenched within the marshes and ruins of the Serpent’s Nest. Request immediate orders before they strike deeper.

— Captain Miron, Varacian Guard, Western Marches.**_"

He folded the parchment tight, held it to a torch until wax hissed and pooled, then pressed the dark seal of the Varacian wolf deep into it.

Turning back, Miron fixed the courier with a look that cut past the rising mist. "Ride east. Change horses at the stone bridge. If anyone tries to stop you, you don't hand this over. Understood?"

The rider's jaw tightened. "Understood, captain."

He slipped the sealed dispatch into a leather tube, strapped it beneath his cloak, close to the ribs.

Miron stepped in, voice dropping to a low rasp: "Tell them this isn't just smoke on the border. Tell them vipers have slipped our fences already."

The courier nodded once, wheeled his horse around. Hooves bit the frozen yard, sparks striking from stones -- then he vanished into the tree - shadowed road, swallowed by dusk and distance.

For a moment, Miron stood silent, listening to the wind hiss through the forts, catching the burnt tang of distant marsh fire.

Behind him, scouts shifted, horses stamped, restless.

Miron drew in a slow breath, shoulders squaring.

"Double the watch on the western track," he ordered, voice steel again. "And no man sleeps till dawn."

As the hoofbeats faded, Miron clenched his fist around empty air. _May God let this letter reach Zevaragrad before steel does._

He cast one last look west, to the black line of forest where shadows gathered thickest -- then turned, cloak brushing earth, and stepped back through the gate. The warning was sent east -- but the real danger still waiting in the dark.

***

**Present day.** 

Afternoon light spilled over the rolling fields of Zevaria's heartland, gilding wheat and stone alike. The road had grown broader these past days, carved by centuries of hooves and wheels; ahead, the land rose and fell in slow, wooden swells.

Inside the envoy's carriage, the air smelled faintly of old wood and travel dust. Maria sat opposite Elaria, veil drawn back from her hair, her gloved hands folded nearly in her lap. Beyond the small window, banners snapped in the breeze, trailing shadows across the ruttled road.

Maria's gaze lingered on the horizon, voice soft but edged with the weariness of long miles.

"Almost seven weeks from Vaelendar to here," she murmured." It feels longer every time."

Elaria tugged her travel cloak tighter, feeling the ache in her shoulders, the dust at her hem.

"And tomorrow... Zevaragrad?"

Maria nodded, the faintest smile touching her mouth.

"Stone walls older than the houses of my birth. And each year they seem to loom larger and closer we draw."

Outside, the late sun caught on Senara's dark braid as she rode alongside the carriage, reins in one hand.

"Seven weeks on the road, and you two still have words left to share?" she called, her grin sharp as flint.

Maria raised a brow, amused.

"Careful Senara. When you're older, you'll find conversation rather easier than silence."

Senara only laughed, urging her horse a little ahead, the envoy's banners flickering in her wake.

Inside, Elaria let the corner of her mouth lift, then sobered.

"Do you ever tire of it? The road, the expectation... carrying a name that truly isn't yours anymore?"

Maria glanced out the window, voice quiet.

"Every mile, sometimes. But duty shapes us more than blood. And if we refuse it, something else -- someone else -- will take our place."

Elaria's gaze dropped to the pendant at her throat: a slim gold oval, catching stray light. At it's heart, a small polished amber stone, warm as trapped dawn.

"And if you never chose the duty yourself?"

Maria's hand drifted briefly to her own brooch -- a small, silver knot of the Dawngard crest.

"Then you do what you can, with the choice you have left."

The carriage rattled on, wheels jarring over ancient stones worn by countless other envoys, other names, other stories.

Outside, the towers of Zevaragrad were still a faint smudge on the horizon — stone against sky.

Inside, Elaria traced the pendant’s edge with her thumb, the amber warm from her skin.

Whatever waited beyond those walls, she reminded herself, she was not here by chance.

***

Dawn spilled pale gold across the southern gates of Zevaragrad. Banners stirred in the morning breeze; from high on the ramparts, a single horn called out, deep and slow, rolling over the waking city.

The Orelian envoy approached at a measured pace: a dark-lacquered carriage flanked by riders, Dawngard outriders in their crimson cloaks keeping close watch. Hooves clapped over the worn stone road, wheels jostling in shallow ruts carved by generations of processions before them.

Inside the carriage, Maria sat opposite Elaria. The road-dust still clung to Maria's cloak hem, her veil pulled back to reveal a calm, travel-worn face. Beyond the small window, Senara could be seen riding a little ahead, straight-backed in the saddle, braid dark against her cloak.

As the city walls gave way to open courtyard, the carriage slowed, gravel crunching under iron-bound wheels. Up ahead, the palace's outer gate stood open: high arches of weathered stone, banners of Zevaria hanging still in the morning air.

Near the base of the wide stone steps leading up to the palace doors, Arlen stood waiting: dark formal cloak draped over one shoulder, gaze steady on the approaching envoy. Behind him, a small cluster of courtiers and guards waited, voices low, speculation passing between them --

what message had Orelia sent, and why now?

The carriage rocked once, then settled. A servant hurried forward, tugging the door open.

Maria stepped down first, boots touching stone, spine held straight despite weeks of travel. Her eyes lifted towards the palace steps, for a moment she paused before Arlen, then her expression softened; she stepped closer and drew him briefly into an embrace.

"Brother," she murmured, voice low but warm. Arlen's arm came around her shoulders, the edge or formality slipping just enough.

"Welcome home, sister," he replied, the words carrying both duty and quiet relief.

Elaria stepped down next, the hem of her travel cloak brushing the palace stone. For a breath, her gaze locked with Arlen's -- quick, unspoken curiosity passing between them. His expression stayed composed, princely, but his eyes measured her in turn: this must be the First Councillor's daughter.

Elaria felt the faintest tightening in her chest -- not quiet nerves, not quiet challenge -- and lowered her gaze, schooling her face to calm.

The envoy leader swung down from his horse, boots striking gravel, cloak settling behind him.

He stepped forward, bowing just enough for courtesy, voice carrying across the courtyard:

"Prince Arlen, heir of King Theron. We come for Orelia bearing letters of goodwill and trade, by the command of the First Councillor."

Arlen inclined his head in a measured nod, one hand resting lightly on his belt -- formal, steady, the gesture of a prince acknowledging an envoy on royal ground.

At those words -- _heir of King Theron_ -- Elaria felt her gaze lift again, sharper this time: so that's him, truly. Not just a figure at the hand of the welcome, but the crown prince himself.

Behind Arlen, the royal family waited in a measured line: King Theron standing tall at the center, the weight, the weight of the rule clear in the quiet set of his brow; young Eran beside him, trying to hold still under the gravity of the moment; and Veyra, with the other sisters arrayed in formal dress, banners drifting in the courtyard breeze overhead.

Veyra stepped forward first, skirts brushing the stone. She paused just a moment, then reached for Maria. They embraced -- not long, but with a closeness that needed no words, the hust of months apart falling away for a heartbeat.

While they spoke in low voices, Arlen turned back to the envoy leader, his reply steady and formal, carrying just enough warmth to sound princely without seeming distant. "In the king's name, you and yours are welcome in Zevaragrad," he said. "Guest quarters have been prepared -- you may rest and refresh before audience."

Behind Maria, Elaria stood still, gaze lifting to take in the royal line gathered: Theron's beard, the watchful set of Veyra's eyes, Eran's quiet attempt to look older than his years. Faces she'd known only by rumour, turned real now under morning light and banners overhead.

Veyra drew back just enough to study her daughter’s face.

“You’ve been too long away, Maria,” she said softly — the words edged with both fondness and quiet reproach.

“And you’ve grown sterner each year I’m gone,” Maria teased back, her smile warming through the weariness of travel.

Victoria, stepped forward next, her greeting quieter, but her smile real. Julia and Layla followed, skirts brushing stone, each with their own quick words -- a touch on Maria's arm, a murmur of welcome that spoke of shared childhood and months apart.

Then Maria turned slightly, hand settling gently at Elaria's shoulder.

"And this," she said, her voice clear enough for the family to hear, "is Lady Elaria -- daughter of the First Councillor Cassimar."

Veyra’s gaze softened; a brief touch of her hand to Elaria’s arm.

“You are welcome, child,” she said, voice carrying both grace and quiet strength.

Victoria, the eldest of Maria’s sisters, added with a small nod,

“You’ll find Zevaragrad less harsh than rumor claims.”

Julia and Layla echoed quieter greetings — polite, watchful, curiosity flickering in their eyes.

Then, at Arlen’s slight gesture, the envoy moved on — boots and hooves crunching over the courtyard stone — toward the open doors of the palace, banners overhead stirring in the morning breeze.
