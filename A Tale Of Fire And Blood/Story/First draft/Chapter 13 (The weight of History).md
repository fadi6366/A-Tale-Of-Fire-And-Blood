# Chapter 13 (The weight of History)


It was yet another day in the city of scrolls, Thalenor. Cold winds, sharp with the scent of salt and ink, blew across the streets. Sunlight fell over the high, impossibly narrow towers and the houses huddled inside the city walls, gilding their grey stone in a fleeting warmth.

In the grand Scriptorium a vast, echoing hall of polished obsidian students bent over massive tables, their quills scratching a restless rhythm against the parchment. The hall itself was a monument to knowledge, its walls lined with floor-to-ceiling shelves that groaned under the weight of over a thousand years of history. The air was still and cool, thick with the scent of old paper and beeswax. It was a place of quiet reverence, where the secrets of the world were not shouted, but whispered from one generation to the next.

Torren sat over the desk beside a window, sunlight pooling across the pages. The room smelled faintly of ink and old parchment, the kind of scent that clung to the archives no matter the reason.

Master Erynd was halfway through explaining the records of early Zevaran kings when a hand went up.

"Yes, Torren?"

Torren hesitated only a moment. "Master I've heard about our ancestors all my life. About Arkan the Conqueror, how he set out and conquered half the world and found our dynasty. I've been told the same stories again and again, from the masters at Zevaragrad, from my father..." he paused for a moment to catch his breath, then continued, "But I want to know more. Are there any scrolls here... about him?"

A faint smile touched the master's lips. "Scrolls? Entire shelves boy. But a story like Arkan's is not found in parchment alone." He stepped towards the shelves, fingers brushing the spines. "I can tell you where the true beginning lies..."

The student sitting on their seats turned their gaze towards the master, attentive. As if they'd waited to hear the story about the Mighty Conqueror since they came to Thalenor. As he sat down on his chair after taking out a book from the shelf, he gestured them to come closer and everyone from the middle and back seats, including Torren came to front ones. Some standing and some pushing themselves into the small spaces left on the seats.

Erynd started to unveil the legend, "So we start centuries ago to the place where currently the Capital city Zevaragrad holds it's place."
Opening the book he took from the shelf, "Ashveil, the tribe of the Fire-born, as it's people used to call themselves, under the lordship of Zevaras was struggling to survive under the pressure of it's neighbouring tribes and the oppressive rulers at that time..."
Torren takes out an apple from the bag he had with him and starts eating as Erynd continued, "they were constantly raided and attacked by other tribes who took gold from them. Zevaras, the lord of Ashveil sometimes even fought battles with those tribes most of them which he actually won and some he lost badly."
A young boy , Tim raised his hand. "Master?... where is Arkan? You said you're gonna tell us about him."
Erynd smiled, "Well my boy, he wasn't born yet. But I can take you directly to that time if you people want." Everyone nodded in approval.
"Alright," the master said, "During these hard times a boy was born, his eyes looked as if the flame of the Pheonix itself."
Tim turned his gaze to Torren who was chewing on his apple, both shared a glance and then looked toward Erynd explaining Arkin's story.
"He grew up to become one of the most skilled fighters of his time, he learned about battle strategy, politics and much more." Erynd gestured with his hand as he continued to explain. "They called him the Prince born of Fire because he saw his birth in the most desperate times, the Ashveil were in."
Tim again with curiosity, "Master Erynd, I've heard he strangled a lion with bare hands is it true?" A small, strangled laugh escaped into the back of his palm as Torren heard his friend asking something almost everyone knows is a myth.
Erynd smiled, "My boy, not always what we hear is true, but he did manage to bring down half the world on it's knees."
Erynd put the book on the table, "After the death of Zevaras, Arkan became the lord of Ashveil, he started to strengthen his tribe and gather allies, and by the time has was twenty-five he had fifty thousand men under his banner, waiting for his word."
Tim looked at gesturing if he had more apples, Torren nodded and he threw one to him, Tim started to eat as Erynd continued.

"He set out to conquer the world, he wanted to bring it to it's knees after years of seeing his tribe suffer and get oppressed. Those years turned an innocent boy into a merciless tyrant. Wherever he went fire and blood followed," Erynd said and in Torren's mind's eye, he could almost see it: cities lit by burning towers, rivers choked red. "those who bent the knee survived, those who don't..."Erynd paused, eyes on the window where the winter light pooled against the glass." Well history doesn't mourn the dead." 

For a heartbeat there was silence.

Torren raised his hand, Erynd gestured in approval to speak, "Master Erynd, how much did he actually conquer...? I mean we hear he took half the world in his lifetime."
Erynd glanced towards the side Torren was sitting, "My boy, when Arkan died, his empire stretched from the eastern shores to halfway towards the current western borders, and from the northern frozen coast down to mountains in the south". 

Torren nodded.

Jack raised his hand, "Master Erynd did Arkan regret this? Killing and burning people." Erynd's gaze matched Jack's, "The world made him cruel my boy, he had no soft corners for the ones who denied him." Jack pressed his lips together as he nodded.

Erynd concluded the story, "After forty eight years of founding the Zevaran Dynasty and the beginning of the Calendar of fire, Arkan finally closed his eyes from this world. The rest of the lands we see as Zevaria today were conquered by his sons and grandsons."

Erynd told them that's enough for today. The boys left the quill and parchment on the table and started to leave the hall. Tim waited for Torren on the door and when Torren came out they chatted and laughed as they walked together towards the yard to get some fresh air after hours of studying. Torren’s laughter faded as the wind cut across the stones. The image of Arkan, his armies sweeping the world, his enemies left broken, sat heavy in his mind. If this was the man who built their house, then maybe the Zevaran crown stood not on honour, but on blood and death.
