# Chapter 6 (Echoes Before the West)

Afternoon light angled through windows, sharp and cold as a drawn blade. It lit the black marble walls on long pale stripes, catching dust that drifted lazily in the chill air.

The solar itself had a quiet stillness, heavy as old stone. The iron sconces stood unlit; torchlight wasn't needed under the sun.

Darius paced the length of the floor, boots tapping sharp against polished stone. Shoulders tight beneath mail and dark silk, jaw clenched, breath frosted slightly as he muttered under it. The court’s words still rang in his ears — Arlen’s name on every noble tongue, called hero of Red River, though it was steel and fire that won the day. And now Father trusts him with the west, as if that alone will hold back raiders and rebel lords. And me? I’m left with silence — and the stain he ordered me to make.

His boots stopped, heel scrapping against stone. Breath harsh in his chest, Darius spat the words out like iron turned bitter on the tongue:

"They call it butchery. But fear keeps banners down faster than any envoy's words."

He turned, jaw clenched so tight it hurt. "And now father sends him west," Darius snarled, voice edged and low, "drapes him in command before the court -- as if mercy alone will guard the marches."

Julian stood leaning against a pillar, half-hidden by pale afternoon light, expression calm as carved marble. His voice came quiet, careful: 
"They see Arlen as hope. You're the blade that keeps that hope alive."

Darius' mouth twisted, bitterness spilling sharper: "If he rides west and wins, they'll call it mercy's triumph. And if he fails... I'm the one they'll send to finish it -- and they'll spit on my name for it."

Julian stepped closer, his tone dipping lower, quietly dangerous: "And if he does fail... standing aside wins you nothing. You were the hand that kept the marches quiet once; you could do it again."

Darius studied his brother, suspicion edged with a need that tasted like rust. "You'd stand with me? Even against him?"

Julian's reply came soft, almost conspiratorial:
"I won't let Zevaria crumble for Father's favourite. Sometimes the realm needs a harder hand."

Silence stretched between them. Beyond the window, cold light caught the dust, turning it to drifting gold.

Darius' hand closer over his sword-belt, anger cooling into something like resolve. "Then let him ride west and play the hero," he muttered.
"If darkness follows him home... so be it."

The light caught Julian's face, half-lit, half-hidden -- the clever brother's smile as unreadable as ever.

***

Dusk settled like a tired hand across the water. The creek outside Zevaragrad caught what little light was left, turning each ripple to hammered bronze.
Wind stirred the reeds, whispering secrets only brothers might hear.

Arlen and Eran sat on the bank, boots damp with black earth. Stones skipped from their hands, flickering across the surface before sinking out of sight.

For a moment, it was just the hush of water, the scrape of stone against palm, and the memory of quieter days.

"Feels like when we used to sneak out here after drills," Eran said, flicking a stone that bounced twice before vanishing.

Arlen's laugh came low. "Yeah. Until you slipped on the bank, and shrieked so loud the night-guard thought wolves had come down from the hills."

Eran snorted, nudging his brother with an elbow.
"You say that like you didn't jump halfway into the creek yourself."

"I was twelve," Arlen shot back, grin pulling at the tired edge of his mouth. "You were half that and twice as loud."

The wind caught the reeds again; for a breath, the years between them felt thin as river mist.

The laughter eased, leaving a quieter space between them.

Arlen let a stone spin from his fingers, voice softer. "I sent word to Fredrick. If he rides hard, he'll reach us before we march."

Eran grinned, tilting his head. "And what'll you tell Victoria if something happens to him? She'd have your hide off your back."

Arlen gave a dry huff, half-amused, half-tired. "I'd pay silver to see her try. She swings a sharper tongue than most men swing a sword."

"A sharper heart too," Eran said, and for a moment they both sobered, the name lingering in the dusk between them.

The creek settled into quiet again, save for the breeze stirring the reeds.

Eran let a stone drop, voice turning serious.
"Then let me come too. I'm ready, Arlen. More ready than they think."

Arlen studied his brother, seeing the hunger there -- the need to do something, to stand beside him.

"You are," Arlen said, voice low. "But not for this road. Not yet."

Eran's jaw tightened. "One day you won't be able to stop me."

A half-laugh from Arlen, quiet but fond. "One day," he agreed. "God help me when it comes."

A soft rustle of cloak broke the quiet -- just enough to turn the brothers' heads.

Elaria stepped from the path, cloak brushing against dry reeds. A stray breeze caught the edge, lifting it around her shoulders before it settled.

Eran caught the look in her eyes first, smirk tugging at his mouth; but he stepped aside, giving space without really leaving.

Her gaze found Arlen -- steady searching -- and for a breath, neither of them spoke.

"I wondered," Elaria said, voice soft but carrying, "what weighs so heavily it sends a prince out at dusk."

Arlen raised a brow, half-amused. "Not every prince runs to brood beside water."

"But this one does," she returned, steady. "So I asked why."

His gaze dropped briefly to the rippling creek.

"Because the quiet answers what the court never can."

Eran chimed in, grin cooked: "Or maybe he just gets tired of hearing 'Your Highness' all day."

Arlen let a quiet laugh. "That too. And because four nights from now, hundreds ride because I said so."

Elaria's voice lowered, almost gentle:
"Then I hope the quiet gave you an answer worth carrying west."

"Maybe," Arlen said. "Or reminded me who I need beside me."

Elaria drew her cloak tighter and stepped closer, then lowered herself to sit on the bank beside him, boots brushing the stones.

"Who is that?" she asked, voice quieter now. "Friend? Brother? Or someone whose loyalty you can't name?"

Arlen's gaze stayed on the water, stone turning in his fingers. "All of them," he said, voice low.
"But some loyalties matter more than crowns."

Eran tipped a stone into the shallows, smirk back in place. "Some of us aren't offered crowns, so we get to speak freely."

Arlen shot him a sidelong look, half-amused. "If you spoke too freely in court, Father would have your tongue before dusk."

Eran laughed, bold as ever: "Only after yours."

Elaria watched them, head tilting slightly, eyes catching something deeper.
"You two speak," she said, voice almost wistful, "as if the world bends to your laughter."

Arlen shook his head faintly, lips tugging at a smile. "Not the world," he said. "Just the part we can still hold."

The laughter faded, leaving only the hush of water and wind in the reeds.

Arlen picked up another stone, turned it in his palm, then sent it skimming across the creek -- five  quick steps before it sank.

For a breath, none of them spoke; dusk thickened around them, and the breeze felt cooler off the water.

Eran cleared his throat, grin cooked: "I should see to the horses... unless you two want a chaperone."

Arlen snorted, glanced over. "Go on."

Elaria arched a brow at Eran's smirk, but said nothing.

Eran stepped back up the path, boots crunching on gravel -- not going far, just enough to give them a moment.

Arlen watched Eran's shape moving towards the horses, then lowered his voice. "Four days isn't much to set the heart at ease."

Elaria's gaze stayed on him, steady. "It never is," she said softly. "Better four days honestly spent than four years pretending."

Arlen let out a slow breath, the last of the sunlight catching his hair. "That's what I keep telling myself."

Elaria turned slightly, eyes tracing the dark line of the city walls in the distance.

"Out there," she murmured, "what you face wears it's true shape. Here, danger smiles and bows."

Arlen caught the edge in her tone, watching her face. "And what shape does danger wear when it walks beside me?"

Her gaze met his -- quiet, unflinching.
"Depends," she said. "On whether you see it coming... or choose not to."

Elaria watched him then, head tilted. "You speak to him," nodding where Eran had wandered, "without weight on your tongue. But to me... every word feels measured."

Arlen's mouth twitched, half-apology, half-truth. "He's my brother," he said. "And you..."
His eyes dropped to the water, voice lower. "You listen like words might matter."

"They do," she said, voice softer than before.
"Even the one left unsaid."

Arlen's gaze held hers a heartbeat longer. "Then I hope I've chosen mine well," he murmured.

Elaria didn't answer. But her eyes stayed on him, steady, unreadable.

Breeze tugged at their cloaks, last light spilling gold across the water.

From the track above, Eran cupped his hands and called, voice bright with mischief:

"Are you two done brooding like love birds, or should I tell the guards to wait another hour?"

Arlen let out a small, surprised laugh -- the sound catching even him off guard. A faint smirk tugged at his mouth before he could stop it.

Elaria's eyes widened a fraction; then the faintest flush rose at her throat. Her lips twitched, half-amused, half-exasperated -- but she didn't deny it.

Their gaze met for a heartbeat, caught somewhere between embarrassment and something unspoken. Almost half a smile on both their faces.

Arlen stepped forward, breaking it first. He offered her his hand.
She hesitated -- then placed her hand in his, cool fingers wrapping around his palm.
Together, they climbed back towards the road, Eran waiting with an impish grin.

Beyond Zevaragrad's black walls caught the dying sun, domes turned to copper.
And in Arlen's thoughts: _Whatever waits in the west, it will find me carrying more than steel._ 

*** 

Evening settled over Oldmere, a small marshland nestled between reed-choked channels and misty pools. About fifty strangers rode in, posing as traders and pilgrims. Dust choked their cloaks; tired smiles played at cracked lips.

The villagers, wary but not unkind, let them pass the low wooden gate. Children ran to watch ahead, dogs barking at unfamiliar scents.
A bent elder asked where they came from; a woman offered water. The strangers spoke little -- but their eyes drank in everything: the worn palisade, the two half-asleep watchmen, the unlatched grain store.

Among the onlookers, Brennar, a thatcher's son barely sixteen, stood with a basket under one arm, He frowned at how the strangers looked not at the people but through them -- measuring walls and counting doors.
A wrongness prickled under his skin, but before he could speak, dusk swallowed the last gold from the marsh.

The traders lingered near the square. One man, older, his cloak darker than the rest, murmured a word under his breath.
Blades slipped from hidden sheaths.

It happened fast: Brenner saw his father step forward, hand half-raised to greet them --
Iron flashed, and the old man staggered, blood blooming bright.

Brenner's breath caught in his throat as the square erupted: men shouting, knives plunging, women screaming.
Horses driven into stalls to scatter livestock; huts set alight, children dragged, crying, running towards wagons; older men cut down without pause.

They cut down what moved, took what could feed them or shine in a saddlebag -- and burned the rest to cinders.

Brenner shrank behind a rain barrel, smoke clawing at his lungs. Just as relief threatened to rise, a shadow fell across him -- and steel slammed the world into darkness.

When the raiders were done, they loaded sacks of grain, iron tools, and what coin they could find. Then they put torch to every roof and wall, leaving nothing but blackened beams and hot ash in the wind.

Smoke curled up into the violet sky, carrying sparks and ash.
By the marsh's edge, the water turned black with reflected firelight.

The stone watch keep of Varacian guard stood above the marsh, grey walls streaked with lichen and old soot.
Evening wind rattled the shutters; torches sputtered against the damp.

Then came the pounding of hooves.
A watchman leaned over the battlements, lantern lifted.
Below, three riders reined in hard, mud and water spraying from their mounts' hooves.

One swung off, cloak flapping, breath ragged.

"Captain Miron! Raiders hit Oldmere -- flying foreign banners!"

The words knifed through the gathering dark. 
Behind him, younger soldiers stiffened, hands going to sword-belts, faces paling as the weight of those words sank in.

Inside the hall, the alarm bell begin to toll -- slow, heavy strokes that rolled across the marshland, telling every farmstead and fishing hut that blood had been spilled.

Captain Miron stood over a rough map table, oil lamp throwing hard lines across his face.
Deep scars crossed his knuckles; old burns stained his leather bracers.

At the messenger's words, his jaw locked, and he slammed a fist on the table, making ink pots jump.

"Damn their crude banners," he muttered, voice a rasp of anger and worry.

He shot orders without pausing: 
"Scouts out -- count their number, watch which way they break from the Nest."

"Pull every farmer and fisher behind the palisade."

"Signal fires -- if they strike Oldmere, they'll come for us next."

Young soldiers scrambled, boots thudding on the stone floor.

Someone outside fumbled with the pitch-soaked baskets, flame flaring in the wind.

Miron's gaze flicked to the small iron cage on the shelf -- the pigeon already sent toward Zevaragrad.
His voice dropped, almost to himself:

"That pigeon better have flown true..."

A weathered sergeant, mail shirt patched and dull, asked low:

"And if no help comes, captain?"

Miron's stare didn't waver, the marsh wind lifting the grey in his hair.

"Then we hold," he said, voice quiet but edged with iron. "Until none of us left to hold."

Outside, the signal fire cracked to life, licking high into the darkening sky.
Down in the marshland, smoke rose from Oldmere -- curling black, against the last silver of dusk.

On the water, flames danced in broken reflections, and the wind carried the bitter tang of ash and burnt again.

Beyond the palisade, night gathered, deep and patient.
And from somewhere far off, the echo of screams faded into nothing.

***

**The evening before the march west.** 

The torchlit hall smelled of old smoke and tallow.
At it's centre, a rough-edged map showed the western marches -- two wide rivers sixty miles apart, with the Serpent's Nest marshland coiled between.

Captain Orvek traced a scarred finger over the rivers.

"One end where they meet -- defendable, but if they circle around, it's a cage."

Another commander pointed east.

"Dense forest here. Few passes good for ambushes -- bad for marching two thousand men."

Arlen studied the map lower,

"I've never ridden west. Father kept me in the east... or the court."

Before silence could settle too long, the doors swung wide. Cool dusk air followed Fredrick Valdrek -- cloak travel-stained, helmet under his arm. A grin tugged at his mouth despite the miles behind him.

Arlen's faced eased.

"Took you long enough."

Fredrick laughed.

"You try crossing five hundred miles of rutted roads and rain-soaked fields."

They clasped arms, a rough hug, and Fredrick thumped his helmet on the table.

"And what mess have you planned this time?"
Fredrick asked.

"We won't march as one," Arlen said. "We split into smaller columns. Traders, pilgrims, patrols -- anything but an army."

Fredrick's brow furrowed, then nodded.

"Then meet again near the palisade outpost . Where Miron keeps watch."

Orvek's frown lingered. 

"If they catch a column alone--"

"Better that," Arlen cut in, "than showing them a host they can see days off."

Fredrick added, half-smiling.

"And if it works, you'll claim it was your idea all along."

"No," Arlen said, half-smiling. "I'll say we had no choice."

The room stilled. Torchlight danced on inked rivers and marshes. Arlen set his hand on the map, voice steady.

"At dawn, we ride west. Whatever waits there... let if find us ready."

A few quiet nods answered. Beyond stone walls, night closed over Zevaragrad -- and far beyond, smoke was already riding.

*** 

Fredrick stepped inside, the door clicking shut behind him.
Travel stained his cloak, dust on his boots, but his gaze went first -- and only -- to her.

Victoria looked up from the table. Relief crossed her face, chased quickly by something sharper, almost scolding. Before either spoke, she moved to him.

No royal grace then, only urgency: arms around his shoulders, pressing her cheek to his chest.
For a heartbeat, the room fell away; just the quiet thud of his heart, her breath catching.

Fredrick let out a breath, low and amused:
"If you squeeze any harder, I'll have no breath left for war."

Victoria drew back, eyes glinting wet:
"Then stay and spare us both the worry."

His hand brushed her arm, guilt and tenderness mingling:
"You know I can't. He's counting on me."

She held his gaze a moment longer, then stepped back.
The mask of the princess settled over her face again -- but it sat thinner now, fragile as rice paper.

She gestured toward the map table, voice steadier than her eyes:
"Tell me what Arlen plans."

Fredrick set down his helmet, fingers tracing river-lines and drawn forests:
"We march west. Two thousand, split into smaller columns. We ride disguised -- traders, pilgrims, patrols. Less likely to be seen before we strike."

"And you meet where?"

"At the palisade where Captain Miron keeps watch."

Victoria listened, the quick mind behind her calm face measuring risk and hope in equal breath.

After a pause, her question came sharper: 
"And if they find one column too soon?"

Fredrick didn't look away:
"Then we fight outnumbered. Better that than marching as a single host and dying in the open."

She pressed her lips together, words caught behind him.
Finally, softer, barely above breath:

"I've heard about men who came back from such expeditions broken or never at all."

Fredrick's voice dropped: 
"And I've seen men who come back whole. Arlen means to be one of them."

"And you?"

He lifted her chin gently, thumb brushing the corner of her mouth:
"If he comes back, so do I."

Her worry shifted -- not only for Fredrick now, but now for the prince whose fate felt tied to them both:

"He's brave, but not careful. And you're careful... but too loyal."

Fredrick's laugh was soft, tinged with weariness:

"That's why we ride together."

"Then watch him, Fredrick. Watch him as if my life depends on it."

He covered her hand with his, palm rough, voice gentler than any vow:
"I might and I will."

For a moment, neither moved -- two figures caught between duty and fear, love too deep for courtly words.

Then slowly, they stepped apart.
Dust from the road clung to his cloak;
fear clung to them both.
Outside, the dusk leaned towards night, and in the shadow of parting, neither dared name what they feared the most: 
that not all goodbyes were meant to end in return.

***

The hearth burned low, throwing restless shadows over old maps and half-written letters. King Theron stood at the window, gaze locked westward.

Queen Veyra entered quietly, skirts brushing stone. Her voice, when it came, was edged with worry.
"You send him to a place he's never seen."

Theron didn't turn.
"He must see it someday."

She stepped closer.
"Someday yes. But now? With scraps of reports and men he barely knows?"

He faced her, eyes tired yet unbending.
"Then he'll learn. A march like this teaches a man faster than any father's words."

Bitterness flickered across her face.
"Or buries him just as quickly."

Theron's jaw tightened. He called it a necessary risk -- that if Arlen would be heir, he must win the frontier's respect.

"You call him heir," she said, softer,
"Yet test him as you wish him to fail."

His voice dropped, gravel-rough.
"I wish him to live. And if he can't... then he never was meant to rule."

She turned, grief dulling her eyes.
"And if he dies? Another son hardened by blood?"

Theron offered no answer.

She stepped closer still, voice barely above a whisper.
"He has his mother's heart, Theron. Don't push him for that."

For a breath, the iron in him softened.
"And his father's blood. Let's see which keeps him alive."

The shadows shifted; Veyra watched him turn back to the west, where duty and fear met in silence.

***

Pale dawn spilled over Zevaragrad. The courtyard stones still held the night’s cold; horses stamped, breath misting into the chill air. Saddles were plain, cloaks travel-stained on purpose, shields slung under rough canvas so no crest would show. A few dozen men waited here, the rest filtering out through side gates and posterns — leaving the city not as an army, but as scattered merchant guards, pilgrims, and hunters.

 For a moment, the city itself seemed to hold its breath, as if it knew what truly rode beyond those cloaks.

The Queen steps close while a stable hand adjusts Arlen's bridle. Her hand comes to rest lightly on his knee, fingertips brushing over worn leather.
"Write when you can," she says -- voice gentler than the cold air around them.

Arlen tries to soften it with humour, faint grin:
"I always did".

A look from her cuts through it.

"No" she corrects, sadness and fondness tangled,
"you didn't".

Their eyes meet; just for a breath, the prince and queen vanish, leaving only a mother and son.
Then the moment slips away, and duty weighs them both back into place.

Eran half-runs across the courtyard stones, boots slipping on morning frost. He stops by Arlen's horse, breathless but trying to look Fierce.

"Bring me a smoke rider's helm!".

Arlen leans down in the saddle, ruffles his little brother's hair -- fingers warm despite the cold.
"Only if you promise not to give Father fresh headaches while I'm gone."

Eran's bravado falters; fear flashes in his eyes. He swallows, looks up, voice smaller:
"Just come back."

Arlen's smile softens, quieter now:
"That part I do promise."

Julian strolls closer, cloak half-open to the morning chill. His usual smirk is still there, but duller, softer at the edges.

Low voice, pitched so only Arlen hears:
"Try not to die. It'd spoil all my plans."

Arlen raises a brow, dry as ever:
"Which plans?"

Julian's mouth twitches, something like reluctant fondness showing through:
"The better ones."

For a heartbeat, neither speaks -- just a brief between brothers. Thin thread of respect, uneasy but real, stretched across old grievances.

Elaria stepped closer, the hem of her cloak brushing stone. Her voice, calm but edged with something almost earnest:
"Bring back something true. Even if it's only a story."

Arlen's gaze held hers, half-curious, half-guarded.
"And if the story's an ugly one?"

A breath, then she answered, quiet and steady:
"Then tell it anyway."

For a heartbeat, the morning noise around them seemed to dull -- the clash of harness, the murmur of men fading behind the weight of those few words.

Arlen inclined his head, almost like a promise, before the moment slipped away and the courtyard filled again with movement and farewells.

As Elaria stepped back, Julia and Maria stood a little apart, watching.
Their shared glance spoke what they didn't say out loud -- a flicker of surprise, maybe worry, at the quiet understanding that had settled between the prince and the girl.

Maria's brow furrowed, as if seeing something she couldn't yet name. Julia's look lingered a moment longer, thoughtful -- then she turned away, as if to give them the last moment unspoken.

Fredrick moved toward his horse, tightening the saddle straps one last time.
Victoria stepped closer, hand brushing against the worn leather pommel, eyes fixed on him rather than the crowd beyond.

"Don't be brave," she murmured, her voice lower than before, nearly lost in the morning breeze. "Be careful."

Fredrick managed a cooked grin, softening only for her. "If I were careful," he teased, "I'd never have spoken to you in the first place".

She let out a faint huff, half a laugh, half a scold. "Idiot," she breathed.

"Yours," he answered, quieter now.

For a heartbeat, the courtyard noise faded. His hand closer over hers, thumb brushing her knuckles -- a quiet vow neither dared voice.
Then duty pulled them back. Fredrick stepped away, warmth of her hand still on his palm.
Victoria said nothing more, only watched as he mounted up, her gaze fixed on him while he turned to the road ahead.

Theron stood on high steps, gaze hard as stone, voice cutting through the courtyard:
"Bring back victory -- or don't come back at all."

Arlen's jaw tightened. He bowed, deep and formal, but didn't answer. For a moment, father and son locked eyes: duty and doubt, pride and fear, all unspoken.

Darius didn't come down.

From the gallery, he watched — wife beside him, just a couple of days returned from her father’s estate, their young son peeking out from her skirts, eyes wide at the men below.

For a moment, Darius' hand rested on the boy's shoulder; then his gaze hardened again, fixed coldly on Arlen.

He turned away without a word, shadows swallowing the family from sight.

Arlen lifted a hand; hooves shifted, leather creaked.
The palace gates swung wide, dawn spilling cold light across the courtyard stones.
He glanced back once — mother’s worry, brothers’ shadows, stone walls that had kept him… and caged him.

Then they rode on, through winding streets still heavy with mist, until the great city gates loomed ahead.
There, the columns broke apart: scattered wagons and riders, dressed as traders, pilgrims — anything but soldiers.

At the edge of the road, Arlen caught Fredrick’s eye. Both men nodded, silent pact made.
Spurs clicked; horses stepped forward.
Behind them, Zevaragrad — gold domes and black walls — slipped from view. Ahead, the road west, where smoke and steel waited.
