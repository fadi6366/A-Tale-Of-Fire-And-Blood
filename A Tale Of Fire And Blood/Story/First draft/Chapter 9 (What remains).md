# Chapter 9 (What remains)

The next day dawn broke cold and grey over the ruin, ash drifting like dark snow across scorched stone. Arlen lay where the fight had dropped him, breath shallow, head pounding until every heartbeat was a hammer behind his eyes. His arm, heavy as iron, lay draped across Fredrick's chest.

For a moment, all he could taste was blood and dust. Then pain speared through his ribs, sharp enough to hear a gasp from his lungs. He blinked hard, clearing grit and dried blood from his lashes, and saw Fredrick's face -- pale, still, eyes closed.

"Fred.... Fred, open your eyes..." his voice rasped out, raw and thin.

Nothing. Only the cold wind. Then, faint as a whisper, Fredrick's lashes fluttered; his lips parted around a ragged groan. Alive -- still alive. Relief hit Arlen so hard it almost double him over.

"Oh buddy... You're alive... Thank God."

Arlen said, smiling. Fredrick smiled back, eyes half closed.

Somewhere beyond the ringing in his ears came the steady beat of hooves. Dust picked up around the ruin, shapes moving through the smoke. Sun glinted off battered mail, off helms dented and blackened by fire. A voice cut the morning air, sharp with shock and hope.

"There! By the tracks -- they're breathing!"

Boots scraped over broken flagstones. A figure dropped beside Arlen, face smeared with soot and sweat. "My prince... Thank God," the soldier murmured, breathless. "Hold still".

Another knelt by Fredrick, pressing fingers to his neck. Relief softened his features when he felt the faint pulse there.

Arlen tried to lift himself, to see more, but the world reeled, vision tunneling to a single scrap of torn violet cloth snapping in the breeze -- the last shred of the Zevaran banner. Shouts blurred into each other: water, stretchers. Hands reached for him.

Strength drained away, sliding from his limb like water through cracked stone. His arm slipped from Fredrick's chest. Darkness lapped at the edge of sight, swallowing light and sound alike.

As the ruin settled into dawn, smoke coiled lazily into the brightening sky, and crows wheeled overhead, black wings cutted silent circles.

Only ten men out of hundreds still drew breath.

They lifted the living onto the carts, half-carried, half-dragged. Westward they rode, toward the fort -- the battered survivors of a column that had ceased to exist.

Hope rode with them too, thin as a dying ember -- but still burning.

Smoke still drifts from the fields; the watchtowers stand black against the morning sky. Ash drifts through the air, catching in cloaks and lashes.

Miron waits by the gate, armour dented, cloak streaked with soot. Around him, captains stand silent, eyes red-rimmed from sleepless nights. Word reached them yesterday: Orvek's column was gone, slaughtered to the last man. Still, they clung to a hope -- that the prince's force had bared better.

Hoofbeats echo across the yard. A scout rides in first, face drawn and grim. Behind him, a battered cart creaks through the gates.

Arlen slumps against the sideboards, dried blood crusted on brow and cheek. Fredrick lies half-propped beside him, breath ragged, face grey as ash. Only eight other men from the column ride behind or are on the carts, staring past the living or unconscious. Out of five hundred.

One captain whispers, voice breaking:

"Oh my God... only ten?"

Another spits in the dirt, rage wrestling disbelief:

"Orvek's wiped... and here? Just these few?"

Miron's jaw tightens; the lines in his face deepen. His gaze drags over the men, counting what's left and what's gone.

A scout pulls Arlen partway upright. The prince's voice comes out cracked, barely there:

"Riders... hundreds of em. They knew the road. Hit us at dawn."

Fredrick stirs, eyes rolling back, then slumps hard against the cart rail.

For a moment, the yard holds nothing but silence and the low rattle of horse track. The fort gates stand open, wind curling banners that look half-torn from their poles.

Miron steps closer, hand heavy of Arlen's shoulder -- not gentle, but steady. Grief burns behind his eyes, buried under command. He glances at the medics, voice flat:

"See to the prince first. Then the rest. Now."

Men move quickly; rough hands ease Arlen and Fredrick from the cart. Bandages unwrap, water poured over dried blood; the wounded groan but do not cry out. The cart wheels grind over trampled mud, leaving a dark trail that dries to rust behind them.

At last, the gates groan shut. Smoke drifts past the battlements; crows watch from the fort top. And in the yard, the ten who came back breath thin, each breath weighted by hundreds who did not.
