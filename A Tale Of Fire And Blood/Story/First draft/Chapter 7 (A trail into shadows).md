# Chapter 7 (A trail into shadows)


**Five weeks later..., Snowtide 5th day, 1701 AC**

Grey dawn finds them on the road west. Breath mists in the cold air; rain from the night still clings to the ruts, turning dust to slick mud. Fredrick rides beside Arlen, his horse's tack creaking like old bones.

Fred starts, teasing, eyes glinting through travel grime.
"That girl from the inn back in Aleskar... the one with the braid who kept leaning over your cup."

Arlen answers with a half-smile, faintly mocking:
"And spill half the mint infusion doing it. I noticed."

Fred chuckles, rain-dark hair sticking to his brow.
"Could've had worse farewells before we left the stones behind."

Arlen's tone stays mild, brushes it aside:
"She'd be bored of me by nightfall."

They ride on, hooves squelching, the mist parting before them.

Fred shifts, voice lower now, a shade more serious.
"Then there's the girl from Orelia. The envoy."

Arlen keeps his gaze on the road, jaw tight.
"We only spoke twice."

Fred pushes, not harsh, just curious:
"About what?"

Arlen's answer is honest, but guarded:
"Little things. The court. How foreign walls feel. What the road west might bring."

Fred glances sideways, measuring him, concern threading through the banter.
"Half Zevarian, I've heard."

Arlen nods, rain running of his cloak, voice dropping softer:
"Her mother died when she was young. That part of her past is only scraps and names."

Fred's words come as a quiet warning, not rebuke:
"Careful, Arlen. Even though she's half Zevarian, but she's raised in the enemy court."

Arlen's mouth twists into a dry smile:
"You think I'd hand her my crown in an evening?"

Fred's reply is gentler, a friend's worry surfacing:
"No. But hearts aren't careful as crowns."

Arlen's voice dips, barely above the clop of hooves:
"There's something there, yes. Small. I don't name it."

They let that sit. Only the wind, the mud, and the slow rythym of their column filling the silence.

Fred lifts the mood, grin spilling back.
"And the boy? Eran'll be talking your ear off when you come home."

Arlen's voice softens, real warmth showing through weariness:
"He'd have ridden beside us if I'd let him. Thinks he'll outshoot you."

Fred laughs, sound short and dry in the morning chill:
"Give him a few years. He'll outtalk us both first."

Arlen's gaze drifts west, quieter:
"He's loud. But his heart's clean, Fred. I'd see him keep it that way."

They crest a low rise. Before them, the western lands stretch wide: rolling grass broken by ruined walls and lonely watchtowers, fewer forests than the east, winds softer but colder with secrets.

Fred gestures with his chin, almost a boyish wonder in his voice:
"Look at it. Almost pretty enough to forget the knives waiting."

Arlen answers, thoughtful, humour wrapped in caution:
"A prettier graveyard is still a graveyard."

Fred chuckles, pushing past the gloom:
"One day, build your hall here. Warm winds, softer winters."

Arlen smirks:
"And mud deep enough to swallow half a host."

Fred's laugh fades into the breeze.
Mist thins as dawn burns through, light cracking on dented helms and damp cloaks. Crows flap up from a roadside ruin, wings black against the grey.

Behind them, their scattered columns snake along the wet road, banners furled against rain, men hunched in saddle and cart.

The west waits, beautiful and cruel.

Late afternoon painted the sky a bruised copper when Arlen's column crested the last rise. The road dipped into what was once a small settlement -- little more than sixty houses and a narrow lane.

The smell reached reached them first. Burnt timber, scorched grain, and beneath it, something worse -- the sour-sweet rot of flesh felt too long in the sun.

Fredrick drew his horse up beside Arlen, squinting at a half-charred sign nailed to a splintered post.
"Myrengard," he read aloud, voice low as if naming the dead.

They rode slowly forward. Blackened beams jutted like broken ribs from collapsed roofs. Ash drifted across the road in lazy eddies, clinging to boots and horse side.  The well in the centre still smoldered faintly; a cart lay overturned nearby, it's iron rim twisted by fire until it looked like a black wearth.

Crows hipped and flapped away as the column advanced, wings catching the dying light. Their calls cut through the hush that had fallen over the men.

Arlen swung down from his saddle, boots sinking a finger's breadth into the ash. Fredrick followed, the two of them picking a careful path through what remained of Myrengard.

Charred breams creaked underfoot, the smell stronger now -- thick enough to taste on the back of the tongue. They passed the husk of a baker's shop, shutters ripped off, the sign half-charred. Ash still dusted the stone counter inside, and what might've been loaves lay scattered and blackened -- turned to lumps of coal no one dared touch.

Fredrick's boots nudged something small. He bent, gloved hand brushing soot away, revealing what had been a child's wooden toy -- half-burned, melted.

Arlen stood silent, gaze moving over blackened walls and cracked earth. His shoulders, tightened, breath leaving him in a slow, controlling exhale.

"They didn't bother to take the bodies,"
Fredrick said at last, voice rough.

"Or they left them for a message," Arlen answered, eyes hard.

They passed what had been a merchant's stall once: counters blackened, roof caved in, clay jars burst and scattered among ashes.

Fredrick's boot nudged a cracked jar; it rolled, spilling scorched grain across the ground.

Fredrick, voice rough:
"Didn't even bother to take the food. Just ruin."

Arlen's gaze swept the wreckage, jaw tightening.
"Or left enough to draw us in. Look at the wagon ruts -- fresh, heading deeper west."

They crouched beside the tracks, ash stirring around them. The wheel-marks cut through soot, unmistakably newer.

Fredrick glanced at him.
"So they're still "out there. Watching."

Arlen, quietly:
"Let them watch. We'll be ready."

They rose, dusted ash from cloaks, and swung back into the saddle.

Behind them, the column crept forward, hooves sinking into grey drifts.

At the end, Fredrick spoke, voice low enough only Arlen could hear:
"A trail into shadow, truly."

Arlen, eyes on the road ahead:
"And we follow it. God help us."

For a breath, neither moved—smoke drifting around their boots, scorched beams creaking in the quiet.
Then the wind shifted, carrying the stink of char and ruin further west—where the tracks led, and where the riders would follow.

***

Twilight bled into the marsh mist, swallowing ruin and road alike. Captain Orvek rode near the front, leather creaking, hand never straying far from his sword. Fog curled around broken arches; marsh water lapped black and silent against mossy stone.

Something moved. Barely -- a ripple where no fish swam, a scrape of iron on rock lost in the wind. His neck prickled cold.
"Shields up," Orvek snapped, voice low but sharp. "Something's wrong."

Before the words had settled, death arrived.

Black-fletched arrows hissed from fog-choked ruin. A young soldier, Petren, glimpsed into the flash too late -- his friend beside him dropped, throat opened to the bone. Petren's shout strangled in his chest as an arrow punched through his lung; breath became liquid; the world tilted crimson.

Shaped surged from the broken walls: Smoke Riders in ragged cloaks, faces daubed black and red, curved sabres already wet. Mud sucked at boots as men scrambled to form a shield line.

Sergeant Halvik raised his shield just in time to catch a blade that carved through wood and flesh alike. He staggered, vision pulsing. Another strike split helm and skull; Halvik fell, torchlight spilling across stone as light dimmed to nothing.

Orvek wheeled, blade catching steel, sparks dancing in the fog. His horse screamed, arrow buried to the fletching in it's neck. Orvek leapt clear, boots splashing into marsh water. Pain shot up his leg, but he kept moving, blade swinging. A rider dragged a man from his saddle and gutted him, entrails streaming in the chill dusk.

Hope flared -- too soon. A mace crushed Orvek's shoulder; bone snapped like dry kindling. His sword spun away, lost in mud and water. He fell back hard onto cracked flagstones, vision splintering.

Above him a tall Smoke Rider, face veiled in smoke-stained cloth. Their eyes locked -- Orvek's hate flaring in the space of a breath.

The rider knelt, dagger cold in hand. Edge met flesh -- a searing bite. Warmth spiled down Orvek's chest as the world tunneled, narrowed, blackened.

Elsewhere, a wounded man crawled for a dropped spear. A boot slammed onto his wrist; a blade flickered down, and struggle ended. Another ran, mud clinging to boots, breath tearing at lungs -- until an arrow drove between ribs, dropping him face-first into stagnant water.

The fight burned belief and brutal. Steel rang, men cried, blood hissed into the wet earth.
Then, silence. Marsh mist rolled back in, soft and uncaring.

Bodies sprawled across blackened stone and reed-choked pools. Crows gathered again on ruined arches, wings folding like closing hands.

Smoke Riders slipped away as swiftly as they'd come -- shadows among reeds, sabres dripping, packs weighed with stolen blades and grain. They left only ruin, silence, and the dying to mark where they'd passed.

***

Ash still floated in the dead air when the first scream split the quiet.

Arlen's column had spread through the ruins, some men dismounted, prodding scorched timbers and half-buried shapes. Hooves clinked on stone; wind dragged soot across old walls. For a moment, it seemed the town had nothing left to give.

Then the dead moved.

Figures wrapped in soot-black cloaks rose among corpses, ash spilling from their shoulders. Blades flashed silver in the dusk. Zevaran soldiers barely turned before the knives slit throats; gurgled cries died half-formed.

From alley mouths and toppled walls, more Smoke Riders poured out, masked faces painted with crude crimson. A thunder of hooves followed: hidden riders swept from the far street, splitting the column like wheat under scythes.

Scouts tried to become orders. Too late.

Lines broke. Swords clanged on stone. Screams tangled with the clash of steel. A standard bearer crumpled under two blades; the banner fell, sinking into blackened mud. A young trooper bolted, terror plain on his face -- cut down before he'd run three steps.

Another man threw himself over a wounded friend; a curved blade bit deep into his spine, dropping them both.

Arlen roared for the men to form ranks, voice hoarse from the dust and fear. His sword caught an attacker's cut, the shock running up to his shoulder. Beside him, Fredrick blocked a strike, but a second blade punched under his guard, sliding into his side; Fredrick dropped to one knee, teeth bared against the pain. His sword slipped from numb fingers — and he crumpled onto his back on the blood‑slick stones, darkness rushing up to claim him.

Arlen pivoted, struck down the assailant — then iron slammed into his **left side**. The world swayed; a searing pain exploded across his ribs. Blood ran hot and slick down his side, soaking his tunic.

His knees buckled, legs giving way beneath him. For a breath he hung there, half-conscious — then crashed to the blood-slick stones.

Through the haze, he glimpsed Fredrick still breathing, chest rising in shallow jerks. Around them the fight broke apart: Smoke Riders wheeled into alleys, leaving ruin, groans, and dying men scattered like broken banners.

Arlen dragged himself forward, elbows slipping in the gore. Inch by inch, pain screaming through him, he reached Fredrick’s side.

With the last of his strength, he flung an arm across Fred’s chest, breath ragged in his throat — then darkness swallowed him whole.

Dawn would find them there -- two figures lying still among ruin and ash, side by side where the road had left them. Whether breath still stirred their chests, none could yet say.
