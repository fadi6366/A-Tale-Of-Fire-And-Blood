# Chapter 12 (The turning of the blade)


The forest a couple miles south-west of Greywatch was hushed, as if the pines themselves were holding their breath. Damp earth muffled the footsteps of men crouched behind brush and fallen logs. Somewhere in the distance, a raven croaked, then silence again.

Arlen lay prone, one hand pressed to the mossy ground, the other resting on the hilt of his sword. Through the gap in the undergrowth, he saw them -- nearly twenty Smoke Riders, their dark leather armour and wolf-pelt cloaks shifting through the trees in loose formation. The faint clink of tack and creak of saddles carried across the still air.

He glanced at Fredrick, crouched a few paces away, then raised his hand in a silent signal. Fredrick relayed it down the line. The archers, already nocking arrows, drew their strings to their cheeks, the bow limbs bending in perfect unison.

The moment stretched, taut as the bowstrings.

Arlen's hand dropped.

The first volley tore through the air with a hiss. Arrows struck with dull, wet impacts. Three riders tumbled from their saddles before they even had time to cry out. Another reeled, clutching at a shaft jutting from his throat, before sliding limply to the ground.

"AMBUSH!" their leader bellowed, voice breaking the stillness like a hammer blow.

Panic rippled through the Smoke Riders. They tried to wheel their mounts, fumbling for shields, but the second volley was already in the air. More bodies fell. A horse screamed, rearing and throwing it's rider.

Arlen didn't wait. "Now!" he shouted, breaking from cover at a run.

His men surged forward with him, boots pounding the loam. Steel rang as swords were drawn mid-charge. The Varacian Guard, disciplined and relentless, hit the dismounted riders first, shields up, blades flashing.

The fight was short and ugly. A Smoke Rider swung an axe at Arlen's head; Arlen ducked under the blow and drove his sword into the man's gut, twisting free before the body hit the ground. Fredrick's blade sliced another's throat, sending blood spraying into the ferns.

Horses bolted into the trees, scattering leaves in their wake. The surviving riders fought in desperate bursts -- lunges, parries, wild swings -- but they were outnumbered and hemmed in on all sides.

"Tell them alive!" Arlen barked, catching a soldier about to deliver a killing stroke.
"We need prisoners."

The tide broke. Two Smoke Riders dropped their weapons and raised their hands. Another was dragged from his horse and pinned, snarling like a cornered dog.

Within minutes, it was over. The forest floor was strewn with bodies -- some dead, some groaning in pain. The arcid smell of blood and sweat hung in the cool air.

"Strip the uniforms from the intact ones," Arlen ordered, wiping his blade on a fallen rider's cloak. "We'll put them to use."

A few men bent to the grim work, tugging buckles and cutting straps. Others searched the dead, pilling weapons, coins, and trinkets into a heap. A pouch of gold coins clinked into Fredrick's hand, and he tossed it to one of the guards with a second glance.

"Take that one," Arlen said, nodding to a body slumped against a tree, an arrow still lodged in it's chest. "We'll see what we can learn from it."

The prisoners were bound, wrists tied tight, their faces pale with rage and fear. The corpse was hoisted over a horse's back, limp and swaying.

When all was ready, Arlen swung into his saddle. The men fell into formation, the loot and captives in tow. The forest swallowed the sounds of battle as quickly as it had carried them, leaving only the creak of leather and the distant call of the same raven.

They turned north toward Greywatch, riding with their spoils, their questions, and their promise of answers.

***

The throne room of Zeveragrad was cold in more ways than one. Pale light filtered through high, narrow windows, gilding the black marble floor. The banners of the Zevaran Empire hung motionless above the long hall, their pheonix sigils staring down at the men kneeling on the runner's edge.

Lord Edward's voice trembled. "Your Majesties... triple the tax is impossible. My people barely survive this season's blight. If you take more, they will starve."

King Theron leaned back in his seat, his eyes sharp like flint. "When Valmorin rose against my crown, you stood among those who fed them coin and grain, also provided them with men. Shall I forget that?"

Edward's head snapped up. "I--"

Darius stepped down from the dais, boots clicking against the marble. His presence seemed to pull the air from the room. "You were their bannermen," he said, voice low but cutting. "And yet we did not take your life when their Banners burned. That mercy was worth more than gold." He stopped a pace away from him. "Now you pay triple. That's the price of breathing."

Edward bowed his head lower, desperation bleeding into his voice. "Please Your Majesty, mercy --"

The guards moved before the plea was finished, stepping forward at a sharp flick of Darius' fingers. They gripped Edward's arms, dragging him upright.

"My people will die ---"

"And yet," Darius interrupted, "You speak still." He unsheathed the sword at his hip -- a short, broad Zevaran officer's blade. The steel caught the light, bright as ice. "You should thank me for not taking your head."

Edward's eyes went wide as the guards forced his right arm out.

"This," Darius said almost conversationally, "is a reminder."

The blade came down with a wet, cracking sound. The lord's scream tore through the hall as his severed hand fell to the marble with a dull slap. Blood spattered across the floor and pooled at Darius' boots.

Silence swallowed the hall.

Theron did not flinch. Elaria's eyes were wide, her knucles tight. Alongside her, Senara had gone pale, a quick glance passing between them before they looked back at Edward.

Julian stood very still, his carved into polite indifference, though his gaze lingered on the blood pooling on the floor. Beside him Eran's eyes closed -- not in fear, but in revulsion.

Theron remained seated, gaze fixed on the mutilated man, a small, cold smirk tugging at his mouth. Queen Veyra's lips parted slightly in shock, though no words came.
Victoria, Leyla and Julia covered their mouths with their hands as if to block the sight, though their eyes stayed fixed on it.

Darius cleaned the sword with a single pull of cloth, his gaze never leaving Edward's contorted face. "Return home and tell your people. Ten days, bring the full sum... or I'll take the rest of you." He let the words hang in the air, a promise rather than threat.

The guards dragged the screaming man from the chamber.

And the court -- still,, hushed -- waited for someone to breathe first.

The prisoners were dragged into the fort's yard, wrists bound, faces streaked with soot and defiance. The Smoke Riders stood as the guards shove them toward the post. A couple of them bore fresh bruises from capture, but their eyes burned hotter than any wound.

Fredrick and the interrogators tried everything -- the first man spat at the ground. The others kept their head down, silent. Even after repeated question from sergeant, they gave nothing -- no reason for their raid.

Arlen watched from the steps, arms crossed. After the third round of questions led nowhere, he shook his head.
"Enough. They'll die before they speak. We're wasting time."

He stepped down into the yard and gestured to a covered stretcher. "Bring the dead one here".

The corpse was laid out on the packed dirt, it's leather jerkin cut open. Beneath the grime and blood, on the right side just below the neck, a raw, puckered brand stood out: a simple curve, ending in two upward horns.

Arlen frowned. "What is this?"

The guards shared glances. One of the prisoners spat toward the ground. "Uruz," he said finally, his voice low but steady. "It means strength. Endurance. We believe in the Norse Gods - Odin, Thor, Freyr. The mark carries their favour."

Arlen's eyes furrowed. "Favour?"

The man bared his teeth. "The Smoke Riders are Vargoth. We ride with the will of the gods. Every man who carries the brand carries their blessing into battle."

"That blessing didn't save him," Arlen said dryly, nudging the corpse with his boot. "Strip him and them."

At his order, the soldiers pulled every scrap of clothing, armour, and weapon from both the dead and the living. The pile of gear grew quickly -- wolf-pelt mantles, braided leather reins, curved sabers, and battered shields painted with jagged runes.

"Keep it all," Arlen said. "We'll ride as Smoke Riders. If we want to get close without raising alarm, we need to look the part."

A soldier hesitated. "The brand, my Prince?"

Arlen's gaze fell again on the burned flash of the corpse. "We'll have it too. Burn it here, exactly as they do". The soldier nodded in agreement.

He turned to the prisoners. "Understand this -- your gods are nothing to me. But if their mark fools your friends, it will serve my purpose." The prisoners share a glance before looking down.

Before the branding, Arlen ordered the blacksmith to craft a crude iron brand.
A blacksmith's hammer rang out in the yard, shaping a small Uruz rune from scrap iron.
Once heated to a searing red in the brazier, the smell of burning metal filled the air.

One by one, the chosen riders stepped forward. The glowing brand was pressed just below the neck -- where the prisoners bore it -- leaving a raw, blistering welt. The pain was part of the disguise. 

***

The blacksmith's fire hissed as the last brand, a glowing ember, was pulled from the brazier. The raw, metallic scent of it hung in the cold night air. One by one, the chosen men stepped forward, and the searing iron met their skin. A hiss, a wince, and the smell of burnt flesh filled the fort’s yard. They bore it with stoic silence, but their eyes held the same flicker of pain and resolve. Arlen was last. He did not flinch as the brand was pressed to his neck, but a muscle in his jaw clenched and brow furrowed as the pain seared into him, a permanent reminder of the choice he had made.

Once the brands had cooled and the men were dressed in the Vargoth's dark gear—the wolf-pelt cloaks, the hardened leather, the braided reins—Arlen turned to face them. His voice was low but carried a steel edge. "From this night, we don't ride as men of Zevaria. We ride as the Smoke Riders. The enemy’s eyes are on our backs. Their blades are pointed at our throats. We will be an echo of their thunder. If we are caught, we will die. But we will not fail."

They fell into a silent, grim formation. Miron stood by the gate, his face a hard mask in the torchlight. He gazed at Arlen before he mounted. "May God help you, my Prince."

Arlen nodded.

He swung into the saddle, and with a silent nod, he led his small band out into the night.

Fredrick brought his horse besides Arlen, gaze at the dark path ahead, his voice low. “Still think this plan’s sane?” He turns his gaze towards Arlen.
Arlen smirked faintly. “No. But it’s ours. I've been doing insane stuff my whole life. ”
Fred gave a single nod, the kind only a friend would understand. "Yeah, and I'm the idiot who keeps following you into it." Arlen gives a small laugh, his gaze meets Fredrick's. “Then let's be idiots together one more time.” Fredrick nods in approval, before they ride off.

The sound of their horses was swallowed by the rustling leaves as they rode toward the Serpent's Nest. Miron watched until the last shadow vanished, then turned away. “Shut the gates.” The great doors groaned closed, sealing the night behind them.
