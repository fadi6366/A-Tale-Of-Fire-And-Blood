# The Traveller's Quest

Centuries before Arkan conquered half of the world. There was a time when these lands weren't unified under one banner of the Phoenix. Drustan, a young lad who loved to travel to far lands and explore the world. He also was into reading books about the history of the world and folk tales as well. Every week at the day of Sappherox he would go to a nearby library in the town he lived, a few hundred miles east from where the Capital territory of Zevaragrad stands today.

This visit to the library was no different than the others. Drustan was reading a book he just found a few weeks ago. It was the folk tale of the a young boy who fell for a Princess who could talk to supernatural beings like fairies and other beings. While he was going through the story he just found appealing he heard some murmurs. Drustan's focus shifted from the book to the two men talking. He heard the man asking something about the map to the Lands of the Lost. The library keeper had dismissed it saying those are just old and made up stories.

Drustan's brows furrowed as he heard about the Lands of the Lost. He had heard about it before but he didn't believe it was real. _What if it is? Why was he asking about that?_ Drustan couldn't help himself from thinking about it now. He always had wanted to explore the world and discover something new.

After the man had left Drustan sat up from his table and placed the book he was reading back in the shelf. He picked up his back and swung it around on his back. He had one hand on the strap as he walked toward the library in-charge. "Excuse me...," The keeper turned toward him. "Yes Drustan? What favour can I offer?"

Drustan looked at the entrance door of the library. "That man...," turning toward the keeper he asked, "what was he talking about?"

The keeper answered, "Aaaahh... Nothin', just some old stories and myths people still believe in."

"You have it? The map?"

"What map?"

"The map to the Lands of the Lost."

"Listen kid..., I' ain' got no map, especially to the lands of the lost."

"Please..., I want the map. I like to travel and see the world."

The keeper was not willing to tell until he saw Drustan take out a small sack of gold coins. Those he got from his last adventure when he helped a merchant find his lost son. Drustan took out some from it and shook his hand slightly, the coins echoed in the keepers ears as he looked at them. 

Drustan pulled his hand back, "The map?"

"Oh yes..., Well so'n, you'd have to give me some of those to know about the what you seek."

Drustan handed ten coins to the keeper, "Now tell me...."

"They say these lands were the ones near the frozen coasts of the Northern Sea."

"And?"

The keeper looked at Drustan's gold sack. "Well you'd have to pay me more to know."

Drustan rolled his eyes as he sighed. He then gave him five more coins.

"Five? That ain't worth the thing I'm about to tell you."

"What? I gave you ten already."

The keeper gestured with his fingers to give him more.

Drustan then gave him five more. "Now?"

"Ride north by the river Azure. When you see the four peaks toward the East, cross the river and ride toward them. There you will find the silent valley. Cross it and..."

"And then I'll find the lands of the lost?"

The keeper shook his head and eyes narrowed. "You've spoken between my words. That costs more," he opened his palm and gestured Drustan to give him more coins.

Drustan hesitated and felt irritated by the keeper asking him for more. He then gave him five more coins.

The keeper took them and put them in his bag. "Now where was I? Oh yes cross the silent valley and there you'll see a village. Beyond the village is forest of the cursed. Don't travel through it during night time. Spend the night at the village. Set out when dawn arrives. Travel on the road that pierces the woods. When that road turns toward north after crossing the forest. From there you will have no village or town ahead of you so make sure you have enough food with ya', or learn to hunt then."

"When do I get to the Lands of the Lost?"

The keeper nodded, "You'll spend days, weeks even months on that road..., until finally you see some mountains ahead covered with snow and stretching east and west as far as your eye can see. Cross those and you'll see the Lands of the Lost."

Drustan looked outside through the door. He sighed. _Well then here we go..._

***

The next day he met his friend Flantock. He told him about the lands he is going to travel to. Flantock didn't agree at first. He also believed they were just folk lore and myths. Drustan told him to trust him. Flantock when he was told about the path they will take, he again denied that this is a dangerous journey. Drustan tried to convince Flantock but he refused. It was too risky and a long journey toward the Northern sea and the Lands of the Lost.

Drustan decided he will set out on this journey by himself. He went home and started to gather the things he would need for the journey ahead. He had already given away twenty five of his couple hundred gold coins to the keeper. He now had to wisely use them. He then bought the things he needed for the journey. He borrowed a cart from a merchant, saying he'll return it after his voyage.

After more than a week of preparing for the journey, Drustan finally had his things loaded and tied on the cart. On the dawn of Joviron after bidding farewell to his mother he sat on the cart and splashed the reins. The wooden wheels creaked as the hooves echoed against the ground. He rode out of the fence that circled around his small cottage. He looked at the road with houses on both sides that led out of the village he lived in and again splashed his rein to move his horse ahead. Drustan was now heading toward another adventure that might take him months or even a couple years or more. 

***

After spending four days on the road Drustan finally saw the sunlight bounce off the water of Azure river from a distance. There lied a village just near the descent he was about to ride down. The village was larger than Drustan's. Being just at a distance from the banks of Azure. The villagers mainly relied on catching and trading fish. Drustan hadn't eaten anything cooked from the last four days as he decided not to stop at any inn or town before he reached Azure. He only halted to spend the night but didn't bother spend the gold on anything to eat until he had the fruit and bread he brought along.

Drustan's horse slowed down as it strode through the town. His gaze just jumped from one stall to another. Some merchant was selling raw mutton, deer meat, or maybe beef. Some stalls had fish on them. Each merchant yelling the prices of the goods they sold. Drustan's gaze halted at a stall, he saw a big fish, his lips brushed across his lips. _This will be enough for the next two days_. 

He stopped his horse and turned behind to check on how much food he had left. The fruit almost had run out. The bread though was enough for the next day. Drustan decided he will buy the fish, but where would he keep it from rotting. He decided to buy just a small piece, enough to keep him going till the dark cloaks over.

He halted his ride just in front of the stall. He got off the cart and walked toward the merchant. "How much for that one?"

"That will be 5 gold coins."

"And how much for this piece?" He put his hand on fish to tell how much he wanted. The merchant told him that would be 1 gold coin and 5 silver. Drustan paid the merchant as he sliced that part off the fish and gave it to Drustan in a leather sack. Drustan shook hands with him and mounted before he rode off. He now had enough food for the next two days to keep him going, maybe three or four if he skipped a meal or two in one day. A couple young boys looked at him as he rode off the road toward the river.

Drustan now was at the first piece of the journey. He now rode along the Azure toward the north. _I'll have to try and catch some fish on my own on the way, the food I have won't last long._ The blue splashed as the river ran down south. Drustan loved that peaceful sound as he gazed ahead.

***

Three weeks had passed and Drustan now had finally learnt to catch some fish, even though he lost much of what he had using a bait. The fish he used to catch prior to now mostly escaped as he had very little experience before. Now after many failed attempts he had caught some. Knowing he can't stock them all up he then started to look out for villages that came in the way as he rode along the blue. He sold his catch and bought food from them. This day he didn't sell it because he didn't catch much. The food he had with him was enough to keep him strong for the next week or maybe nine or ten days. He didn't feel like selling to get money for buying more. 

But fortune isn't kind to a person always...

One day while he was sitting on the bank, trying to catch a fish. He heard footsteps approach. He stood up and just as he was about to turn behind, he felt a cold dagger on his throat. "Give us..., give us what you have." It were a couple thieves who had seen Drustan's cart and had come to take the goods. They had been on his trail for a couple days, keeping their distance for him not to notice.

Drustan begged them not to do this, but they weren't going to listen. They searched Drustan and found the sack he had with gold inside. They took it along the money he made by catching and selling fish. They then checked the cart for valuables. At the end one of them decided they will take the entire thing. Drustan was now left empty handed after the thieves rode off. The horse strode away dragging the cart he had borrowed. He looked at them in despair as they disappeared in the distance. 

Drustan was now stranded in the middle of nowhere. He couldn't go back without the cart, the merchant won't leave him. He wanted to continue the journey ahead, he didn't do all that just to walk back home. Drustan decided he would walk ahead now until he finds a village or an inn. 

***

Drustan had been walking now for three days. He was exhausted now. Trinkets and leaves snapped under his shoes as he strode along the trees on the bank. He now relied on what nature had to offer him. Tree leaves, some fruit from trees or maybe some wild creature he might catch. Anyone's will to carry on would have broken by what he had gone through now without the supplies he had brought. But Drustan really wanted to go this place he had been hearing about.

After days of walking he saw some cottages ahead in a distance. A smile lit up his face. He now gathered what strength he had left in him and walked toward the town ahead. He came across a merchant's stall who was selling fish and some other things as well. Drustan now needed money and food as well. He asked the merchant if he can work on his stall for him, maybe catch fish or stay at the shop and help with selling things and trade. The merchant didn't accept as wasn't going to trust a stranger with his work. Drustan nodded and moved ahead toward another stall.

After the same response from half a dozen merchants, Drustan now sat along side the road thinking about what happened in the past few weeks. He now thought why even he started this journey. After sitting there for a while, something inside him told him to ask another merchant just one last time maybe he gets to work there and makes enough money to carry on ahead.

Drustan approached the one who's stall was just across the street. He was a bit older man who had lost both his sons a few years ago. Some merchant had them killed due to trading reasons. The old man had then left that town and came to settle here and made a small shop that would earn him enough to spend his remaining days in peace.

When he heard Drustan asking for work. The old man first thought for some moments after listening to Drustan's story. He then told him to come and sit beside him. "Listen..., child. I don't have much to offer you in return. I can give you a place to lay at dark and one time meal. If you ask me for money I can pay you ten silver for one week of work. I don't earn much and I have to feed my wife as well from it. She's old...," he coughed along a small laugh, "Old like me. I hope that will be enough for you."

Drustan knew he desperately needed any money he got. Something was better than nothing, he thought. Drustan agreed to work at the old man's stall. Ten silver after seven days was not much but he had no other options. The richer merchants had denied him and now this was the only one who will be of use to him.

Drustan now worked for the old man. He would open up his stall in the morning and set things up. He would stand at the counter and delt with the people who came to buy things. Now the old man could even skip days of being at the shop as Drustan had earned his trust after working there for a month.

***

It had been six months now since Drustan had started to work for the old man. He didn't seek treasure, he didn't look out for a magical artifact or some ancient relic. He just wanted to see the lands he had been intrigued hearing about. That kept him firm on what he was doing. Six months had earned him some money but still it wasn't enough. So after he spent two months with the old man there, he started to work more to earn more. He would go off early in the morning and bring in fish he caught. He then used to sell that, other merchants didn't like that and even opposed but he kept working.

The merchants even tried to talk to the old man about Drusten, but he had now started to trust Drusten. The old man seemed to have found a son in a stranger who now had helped him in his work. The old man had also increased the wage he gave to Drusten, now he would give him fifteen silver coins after seven days since the last one month. 

Drusten also now started to help the travellers by repairing their horse shoes. He himself was a traveller and explorer so knew a bit of that skill as well. Drustan wanted to buy a horse and a cart to carry on what he came for but the money he had still wasn't enough. A part of him also didn't want to leave this town as he unknowingly he became fond of it.

One day a man came to Drusten to buy some fish. He had his wife along side him. They were talking about the northern lands as their home was there. Drustan heard them speaking and after they'd bought and paid him he asked. "Do you know about the Lands of the Lost?"

The man answered, "What? Those folk stories? I haven't been there but what I heard about them is some elves and dwarfs used to roam those lands centuries before humans appeared," he squenched his lips, "Maybe even after humans appeared they might have lived there. But it is said they're not there anymore. I don't believe all this. Dwarfs? Elves? Who even comes up with all this?"

Drusten didn't speak further, he now knew no one believed in this. But hearing about elves and dwarfs, he found another thing to make him more curious about this place he was already so eager to explore. The old man had heard Drusten ask them about those lands. He knew Drusten was a traveller who had come to him months ago because he had been looted. The thought of this young lad now finally setting off on his journey didn't feel quite good as he had grew fond of Drusten. But he had to allow the boy make his own choice. He had spent enough time and worked hard enough that the old man's stall had grew now. Now the time of his departure slowly neared.

***
A few days passed and the old man called Drusten while he was setting up the shop for the day. It was Joviron, the day Drusten received his weekly wage. The old man knew Drusten wanted to go North. He gestured him to come and sit beside him on a chair.

The old man put his hand on Drusten's shoulder, he said, "You were like my own son to me..., I never thought you would stay with us with so much little that I've been paying you. I know you want to leave some day and go to the Lands you seek. As a token of my gratitude for what you've done for us and our this little source of money...," he paused for a moment. "I am old and can't ride anymore." He then pointed toward a white mare tied to the rail, "You can take this..., it's no use of mine anyways. She will take you to the lands you want to go." 

Drusten hesitated, he replied, "But it's yours..., I can't just take it."

The man smiled and answered, "I know I haven't been able to pay you enough for what you've done for us. Take it you've earned it."

Drusten looked at the mare, he didn't have any words to say.

The man further added, "I'm sorry..., I couldn't give you a cart..."

Drusten put held the man's hand and placed his other one over it, "It's fine..., I'm very grateful of what you've done. I..., I don't know how to repay..."

The man shook his head and told Drusten he didn't have to do anything. He further added, "I know you want to go..., I wont stop you."

Drusten thanked the man then stood up and walked toward the mare. He rubbed his hand softly over it's neck. He looked in it's eye. The old lady came toward them, she gave Drussten some food to take with him for the road. Drusten remembered the day he first departed from home, the final goodbye with his mother before leaving. This almost felt the same.

Drusten now had some money as well, not much to be compared to the gold coins he brought along but enough to help him survive at least. He would now do the same he had been doing, try to save the food, eat once a day and maybe catch some as long as he had to travel along the banks of Azure. He then packed up his goods and tied them to the saddle of the horse. He gave the old couple a final hug and smiles after he mounted the mare before he set off. The journey was far from over. Weeks..., even months waited for him ahead.

***

It had been more than a month now since Drusten left that town. He was amazed by how long the Azure was. He had spent almost two months on the road but he still rode by the banks of it. His gaze was constantly beyond the river looking for the peaks. Mountains did start to appear but nothing so far looked like four distinct peaks. After travelling for almost half a week looking for them among those mountains from afar his gaze stumbled upon them. Still far ahead but now he could see them. 

The mountains that had started to look higher by the mile as he rode for days looking at that side. The four peaks stood distinct and higher among them. High enough as they some might climb up the clouds if stood upon them. The top covered in white but not the full mountains. Drusten saw them from far but he wasn't there yet to cross the river. He sped up his mount now to reach faster, after maybe three days or four he reached the spot where he had to cross the Azure.

He couldn't get across without a boat. Even though the river was a bit narrow at that point but not shallow enough to run the mare across. Drusten swung off his mount and stared at the river. _I should have gotten across earlier._ He sighed as his fist softly beat against his forehead. He now looked ahead the road and behind, there were not enough trees for him to take wood to build a vessel. He sat on the bank, his feet hung as the cold water flowed, he felt the cool on them.

He couldn't ride back to get wood, even if he had it wouldn't have been easy. He hadn't built a boat by himself. He did travel before and crossed rivers but he had people alongside him with whom he worked together to build. After sitting there for some moments he looked in his bag for money he had left. It was enough for him to pay someone to get him across as he had been doing what he used to before getting robbed, catching fish and selling it whenever he passed through a town on the road. 

Drusten then stood up and brushed the dust off his attire with hands. He mounted the mare and rode ahead hoping to find a town or village. As he rode north it started to get colder now. The days were still warm enough but the nights were colder. The breeze was more colder as he was riding on the bank of a river.

***

The four peaks started to look farther as he had rode ahead from the point where he had to cross. He looked at them as they grew smaller. After striding for two days he saw a small village just across the river. Hope lingered inside him as he saw the cottages and smoke rise from the chimneys. He halted just opposite the village. Dismounting he cried out loud, a man who had just caught some fish on the other side of the river heard the voice of a stranger reaching out.

The man looked at him with narrow eyes. Drusten moved his arms high as he yelled, asking for anyone who could help him cross the river. The man told him to wait till dawn as the sailor who owns the boat, that was docked nearby wasn't there. Drusten showed his gratitude to the person and tied the mare to a tree. Then he took some food out of the bag tied to the saddle. The horizon turned red and gold as dusk approached. Drusten took out the cloth he had been using to spend the nights while on the road. He gathered some trinkets and cut down some wood from nearby trees, just enough to start a fire.

As the night cloaked Drusten sat beside the fire and cooked the food. He prepared a stew for himself with vegetables and the fish meat he had. Luckily as it got colder at the north the meat didn't rot. He fed the mare some grass whom he had tied by the tree. He looked at the village across the blue. The sight of light coming from the wooden cottages, the smoke rising from the chimneys under the dark sky filled with stars caught his eye. He sat down resting his back by the tree as he stared at it, admiring the beauty of the scene. 

Already tired from his travel it was not long until he started to feel dizzy from it. He then took that cloth and spread it by the tree. He took cloaked one over himself and lied down hoping this time no one comes to rob him. He dozed off with the fire burning just beside him, warming him in the cold night.

***

The next dawn was quiet. Birds chirped as the sky lightened up. Drusten rubbed his eyes as he opened them, welcoming the new day. He stretched his arms. Even though he didn't get the comfort of a warm bed but he did managed to sleep well somehow. There was something in that dawn, a warmth he felt. He looked at the village across the river and then his gaze roamed further beyond. He looked at the four peaks that were now a bit far away. 

The village also had woken up. Drusten could see the people coming out from their homes. He looked at the boat docked there. The sailor didn't arrive yet. Drusten put aside the cloth covering him in the night. He packed it and put it in the bag, tying it along his stuff with the saddle. While he was doing this the sailor had arrived. He would take the people of the village across the river and earn money, this day was same for him like any other.

Drusten saw the sailor and started to call him, like he did the day prior to the villager. The sailor saw the stranger on the other side calling him to get him across. At first he couldn't understand Drusten but when he spoke a bit louder after the sailor gestured, he understood. He untied the boat from the pier. The sailor rowed his boat toward Drusten, pushing the water back with the ores as the boat moved ahead.

The boat touched the bank on the side Drusten was. He helped the sailor dock the boat. Drusten took the rope and tied it to a small tree that was just on the edge of the bank. The sailor knew this stranger wanted to cross. Drusten asked him if he can get the mare across as well, the boat wasn't small though, it could be possible.

The sailor looked at it and said, "That'll cost ya' extra."

Drusten asked, "How much?"

The sailor took a few steps toward the mare and answered, "If only you come, that will be twenty silver coins, if she comes along I'll need forty."

Drusten looked inside his bag, he had some above a hundred coins of silver and ten gold as well. He had been working well during his stay with the old man and then after that. He knew there was a long road ahead and once he crossed the Azure, there would be no fish to catch and sell. He had to spend the money carefully. He let out a sigh and looked at the sailor. "Isn't that too much? We just have to cross the river."

"Listen young man..., that's how much it usually costs here and it's a fair price for a horse to come along with us."

"But forty coins is still too much..., can't you look for a more fairer price. I'll give you twenty five."

"Twenty coins are for you to cross..., if you want to bring your mount along, five coins ain' enough for her."

Drusten's jaw tightened, he tried to keep his calm. "Thirty!! That's all I can give."

The sailor looked at Drusten, _It is the first for the day..., I didn't came here for nothing, at least I need to make it worth going back now._ he nodded. "Fine..., I'll take you both across for thirty silver." 

A rush ran through Drusten's body. He was happy to finally now go across. One part of his journey to the mysterious land was now over. Drusten untied the rein of her from the tree, the sailor untied the boat. Drusten pulled her toward the boat. At first the animal hesitated and neighed but eventually she stepped on the boat. Drusten let out a sigh of relief. He looked at the sailor and smiled. The sailor gestured him to sit down. He then started to row, the boat slowly moved across as the ores pushed the water back. The calm sound was a treat to Drusten's ears. Now the next part of his journey was about to begin.
