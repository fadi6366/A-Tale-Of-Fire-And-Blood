Q1: Why did Theron take 60000 army while rebels were larger in number?
Ans: Because one of the scouts they sent was compromised and a Kantari man returned. Giving them wrong intel about the numbers of Kantari. He was later caught but that was during the march toward the Kantari region. Then Arlen came up with the plan of surprise and attack. Because the initial strategy wouldn't have worked.
