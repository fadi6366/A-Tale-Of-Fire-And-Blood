Outline: 

Capital / Palace:
An assassination attempt on Arlen inside the capital — perhaps at night, or while moving through the palace.
His allies quietly warn him: it’s too dangerous to stay; lay low until the dust settles.
The escape:
Arlen slips out of the capital, taking only:
Julia Zevaran
Eran Zevaran
Elaria Navaryn
Fredrick Valdrek

A small escort: about a dozen hand-picked, trusted soldiers.
Near the Turk border:
They’re ambushed by assassins disguised as Free Arm mercenaries.
Fierce fight: Fredrick is badly wounded.
They survive, shaken and bloodied.

Reaching Turk lands:
They arrive at the Turk capital / seat.
Arlen explains what happened to a local bey (frontier lord).

The bey, respecting old Zevaran–Turk pacts and seeing the danger, agrees to shelter Julia, Fredrick, and Elaria while they recover.

Arlen’s decision:
Determined to find the truth behind the attack.

Leaves Fredrick, Julia, and Elaria under the bey’s protection.
Sets off west toward the Free Arm stronghold, taking only:
Eran
And two loyal soldiers.

Goal: confront the Free Arm leader and see if they betrayed him — or if someone else is framing them.
