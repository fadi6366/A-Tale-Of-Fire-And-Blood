"The sun turned red."

Elaria's eyes widened as she froze. A chill crawled up her spine, stealing her breath for a moment. She asked, "How did you know?"

"Because that's what I've been seeing as well. It always starts the same, those children, that village...," he paused. "Then fire rises and burns everything, but today I saw the same thing you told. The sky and the sun turned red."

Elaria swallowed, _How can this be?_ "I..., don't understand. How can we be having the same dream?"

"I also don't understand what is going on....," he tightened his fist as his gaze flickered around. He then met gaze and asked, "How long it has been, since you're getting those dreams?"

"I think a couple weeks before we left Bayside landing. What about you? How long it's been since you started to get those?"

"I think it's the same time when you got them."

Elaria didn't say anything. She just nodded. Arlen covered his lips with his hand, he took a few steps around slowly. Elaria stood by the pillar, arms crossed she just watched Arlen. Both of them didn't speak for a while. The cold wind brushed her hair against her eyes and cheeks. Arlen looked at her and their gaze met. His heart as it would have stopped for a moment. But this was not a moment for that and he knew it. Elaria's grip on her arms tightened without her noticing.

Arlen broke the gaze, Elaria also took her eyes off. "This can't be a coincidence."

"You're right..., but how? I mean what can be the reason."

"The only way is to find it out...," Arlen stepped closer toward her. "Not a word to anyone. I don't know what's going to happen in the court tomorrow. Either you'll stay or not. But you have to keep this between us, until we get an answer to this."

Elaria nodded, "Fine..., I won't tell anyone about this."

Arlen let out a sigh. He looked outside, the horizon was lighting up. "I think we should now go to sleep, it's a huge day tomorrow."

Elaria nodded. Arlen then walked toward the door.

"What if your father doesn't let us stay?"

"Then I'll come and find you, well..., we have to find out about this right?"

"Yes...," Elaria smiled, _Idiot_ . "Yes..., we have."

He smiled and pulled the door, the hinges creaked as it swung open. Elaria watched him as he shut it close behind him. She let out a sigh and looked at the moon. She quietly whispered to herself, "You're right..., it is indeed a big day."

Elaria straightened and walked toward the chamber, her steps echoed in the calm of the night.
