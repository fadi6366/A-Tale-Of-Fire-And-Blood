Elaria crossed her arms as she leant by the railing, her body now facing Arlen, she tilted her head, "And dare I ask why? The heir wasn't on the festival."

"The war..., in the south, it took us three years to go there, fight and then return," Arlen answered, with a sigh.

Elaria was curious now, after hearing about the war from the Prince himself. She added, "Well..., I've heard a lot about this war..., and..."

"And what...? What did you hear?" Arlen's eyes narrowed, his forehead stiffened.

"They..., talked about a young Prince who, won every battle there, which he led his army into."

"What else did they say about this Prince?" Arlen now also crossed his arms as he leant with the rail, tilting his head.

"They say he brought the South to it's knees."

Arlen's lips curved into a faint smile, _Well I did beat the hell out of them_. But then he remembered the villages he raided, _And the innocents we cut down_. His mind recalled that mother and those children, the dream he was having of his past ghosts. The smile on his face fainted, his jaw tightened, he looked down toward the yard below.

Elaria noticed the sudden shift, she saw his smile faint, she asked, "Did I say something wrong?"

Arlen answered, "No..., no...," he paused and let out a sigh, "It's nothing..." 

Both of them didn't speak, for some moments. Elaria understood he had something in him that kept him at unrest, she took a breath, and turned her back toward the railing, leaning on it, arms crossed, "I lost my mother when I was young."

Arlen looked at her, he saw her face which was lit up and smiling just moments before, now faded into something like a flower that looses it's colour when it withers. He said, "I'm sorry."

"It's fine. You don't have to be sorry," she swallowed as she answered.

"What happened to her?"

"They say she fell sick, and died a few days later. Other than that I don't know, neither did anyone bother tell me all these years."

Arlen looked down at the gate, his eyes narrowed, _Maybe she didn't fall sick, maybe she was killed, poisoned maybe?She was from our lands after all. I don't know, I'm just thinking too much._ He turned toward her, "So that's why you weren't able to sleep? You miss you mother?" he asked, voice low and warm. 

"No."

"Then what?" his eyes glared.

"I..., I don't know how to put it into words...," she paused, looking down at her hands, one resting on her palm, she continued "It's a dream I've been having."

Arlen felt a chill run across his body, _What? A dream? I'm also having one._ He swallowed, and closed his eyes for a moment and opened them with a sigh, he asked, "Can I ask what kind of dream? What did you see?"

Elaria's body shivered from the cold, she crossed her arms tightly, she answered in a low voice, "It starts normal, I'm standing in front of the medics chamber, then I hear cries from inside. A lady comes out saying your mother is dead," she paused to take a breath.

Arlen felt like connecting the dots, _Like the dream I get about those children and their mother_. He asked, "And...? You said it's normal at first, what comes after?"

Elaria looked at him, "Then everything is ingulfed into blood and flames, I see a red light falling everywhere, it comes from the moon, or the sun I don't know..., and then...," she paused, "Fire rises from everywhere, and it reaches me, before I get burned I wake up."

Arlen's eyes widened, he swallowed, he placed his hand on her shoulder, he asked, his voice shivering this time, "Do you feel something? After you wake up? A pain or a burn?"

Elaria nodded, she placed her hand on her chest, "A burn, here, like someone's lit up a fire inside."

_Oooh crraaa...ppp that's the same dream I get_  Arlen seemed frozen in a shock. He couldn't understand what was happening.

Elaria looked at him, she asked, "What happened?"

"That's the same dream I've been saying, first it shows me a thing from my past and the same thing what you told me," he swallowed as he continued, "And then..., when I wake up I feel that, burn too in my chest."

"What...?"

"Yes..., I have been feeling it for months now, well..., the dream of blood and fire, it happened today...," he looked into her eyes, "but the burn..., it's been here."

"So..., what do you see? before the fire comes?"

Arlen sighed, he didn't speak for a moment, but answered eventually, "I also see a ghost from the past, something..., I wish would have been different."

"Can I ask what is that haunts you?" she asked, tilting her head slightly.

Arlen clenched his fingers, his jaw tightened as he looked away. _Should I tell her? Come on it's not much of a deal, she has told hers, why shouldn't I_.  He looked at her and took a deep breath, her brows raised. He answered, "During the raids we did, the war south...."

"Yes...? What about them?"

"While raiding one of the villages, I killed a boy and a girl in front of their mother, up until then I was fine. But...," he blinked and his eyes turned away, "When I saw in her eyes, before I killed her as well. That moment haunts me now..., I've killed hundreds of innocents like this."

She nodded, and asked, "So..., you see yourself in that place? And then everything is surrounded by fire."

"Well..., something like that."

"How is this happening", she straightened, her eyes narrowed as she looked at him.

"I don't know, it can be a coincidence but...."

Elaria cut his words, "No! It's not..., I have been having this dream since we left Dragonsweil."

Arlen had his fingers curled in front of his lips as she spoke, her gaze on him, but his eyes switched between her and the floor. He thought for a moment, _So she's getting them after landing here.._ He looked at her and asked, "You said you saw that moment when your mother passed away, in your dream, right?"

Elaria nodded.

"You've been having that since you landed here or? the next thing."

"The next thing, when everything is surrounded by blood and then fire rises."

"Then this is not a coincidence, something is up, something..., we haven't seen...," his tone hardened, "Not for now."

Elaria turned toward the railing, she rested her hands on it, staring at the horizon. _I was sent here to spy on them, now I'm caught in this..._
