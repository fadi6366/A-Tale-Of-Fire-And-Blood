"You seem to travel a lot, first those islands and now..., here."

"Yes..., it's like Fate just keeps dragging me from one place to another."

Arlen's eyes narrowed, _The King's order?_  "May I ask why? I mean sending a high-born lady to a land halfway across the world."

Elaria looked at him, _Does he suspect? I shouldn't have mentioned the King. What do I say to him?_ She swallowed, "The King wanted me to accompany the envoy, bringing the new peace offering to your King."

Arlen tightened his jaw, his brows relaxed. "So..., that means you're not going to stay for long," he said, but in a low voice.

Jason stared at them sitting at the table, he shared glances with Fred and Eran grinning along with them. He took sips from the urn as he watched. Fred saw Senara walk toward him, curled his fingers in front of him mouth and coughed. Jason looked at him and Fred gestured with his eyes to look behind. Jason turned and saw Senara walk toward him. Fred gestured toward Eran and they both left the table.

"You seemed to have loved that drink too much I think," Senara smiled as she said, gesturing at the urn in his hand.

Jason put the urn aside on the table and stood up. "I was just..., enjoying with my brothers."

Senara looked at Arlen, she said, "Your friend seems to be busy," Senara stepped closer as Jason glanced at them. "They look good together don't they."

"They sure do..., he seems to have forgotten himself completely since he's seen her," he said before turning toward her, "Anyways..., how was the food here?"

Senara squinched her lips, tilting her head slightly. "It was good, not what I expected but..., it was better than the last one we stayed at."

"Well that makes at least the two of us..., who think this way," Jason said, a half-laugh escaping his lips.

Elaria took a sigh, "I don't know..., it depends what your father says..., if he allows us..., I might be able to stay in the lands my mother was from."

Arlen curled his lips and his head raised slightly. "Oh..., right..., My sister told me she..."

"She died..., I was three at that time," Elaria said in a soft voice.

"So you think about her? Since you're in her home lands."

Elaria swallowed, "Yes..., since I got word from my father that I'll be joining Azekial to sail here. I have been thinking about her," she paused, "I barely remember her face..., only the day when they told me she's no more."

Arlen answered, "May her soul be blessed."

Elaria nodded, her eyes turned toward the window.

Senara smiled, "Yes...," she looked at Elaria as she her gaze stared outside.

Jason also glanced toward them beside the window. "She doesn't look too good there," they both looked at each other. "Is everything all right?" he asked.

Senara let out a sigh, she leant by the back of the chair. "Her mother was from these lands, losing her while she was just three..., it weighs on her. Ever since we've left Bayside Landing, she's been thinking about her."

Jason nodded, he looked at Elaria, "Yes..., it must have weighed heavy," he swallowed.
