# Chapter 2 (Sons of Zevaran)

**Four days later..., Ironhallow 26th day, 1700 AC**

The evening sun threw it's pale light through the clouds over the walls of Zevaragrad, the towers and houses casting shadows in the city. These walls had seen many hosts depart and arrive to the Capital, standing tall for centuries, protecting the ones inside and keeping the invaders away. The violet banners of the Zevaran dynasty with the golden-orange Pheonix at the centre with it flaming wings open, facing  as if it watches the ones who pass in front, flapping as the wind blew across. A whisper of white dusted the roofs of towers and buildings as winter approached.

The bells tolled in the high towers marking the evening hour, as the imperial host arrived at the city gates. The guard standing at the wall above the main gate asserted, "Open the gates... They are here." The gates opened with a creaking sound coming from their massive hinges as a soldier pushed them apart as the host approached. King Theron with Arlen beside him entered first with the column following them behind. 

The guards at the gates greeted them with their hands on chest and head bowing, "Your Majesty..., ". Theron and Arlen nodded as they walked through. Nikolai and other commanders followed along with the cavalry and infantry behind them, the gates closed as the last imperial soldier walked through.

People started gathering on both sides of the pathway the King and Prince rode on. "Long live King Theron..., Long live Prince Arlen..., Long live Zevaria...," they shouted in a rhythmatic manner. 
As they passed by a merchant shop near the small tiled road leading to the market, two merchants, wearing leather caps, vegetables and fruits in the hands of them both, Voron murmured, "So they've crushed the Kantari rebellion". 

"Prince Darius isn't with them, if the rumours are true, then God knows in how much blood the south bathes now." Mirad answered, jaw tightened.
"Well they chose this for them... they rose against the king and met their fate." Voron added. Mirad nodded before they both returned to their shops to continue their work.

Hearing the peoples' cheers, Theron addressed Arlen, his gaze forward, "They praise you..., consider you hero of the battle." 

Arlen glaring at the road ahead, without further lifting his head, "They don't know what happened father. Not truly."

Theron with a smirk on his face, " They know, son. They know for the better, word spreads like wildfire these days. Besides we did what was necessary."

Arlen closed his eyes for couple moments, took a deep breath, it condensed into a small fog as he let it out, as if words almost slipped out of his mouth, opening them only to see the path ahead as he rode.

The column behind them started to scatter as the soldiers started to walk towards their homes, their families standing in the crowd or the roads towards the barracks. Leaving only the Royal Guard along the King and his son as they rode towards the palace.

At the gate of the royal palace, the two young princes , Torren Zevaran, a young scholar, in his scholar dress and Eran Zevaran, the youngest of the siblings, a bow in his hand and the arrow bag strapped on his back, eyes searching for his favourite brother Arlen as he saw the host approached. When they closed in Eran waved his hand in excitement, Arlen saw it and a smile ran across his dull face, he gave a gesture back to his younger brother and halted his horse near him.

Arlen dismounted his horse and sat down as Eran and Torren ran towards him, a brief but warm embrace between Eran and Arlen. "You're Okay, I worried you'll get into some trouble without me", his tone teasing and confident.

As Eran backed from the embrace, Arlen with a smile on his face, fingers curling through his younger brother's hair, "You know nothing will harm me as long as you guys, and mother are praying for me." He gave Eran a kiss on his forehead. 

Torren standing just behind Eran, "Excuse me... there is another one here as well," Arlen's gaze turned toward him, "Torren..., ah my young savant." he said as Torren came ahead and they hugged. Then the three of them walked through the gate towards the courtyard.

Across it their mother, Queen Veyra in her royal drapes was standing, she opened her arms as Arlen came closer and a warm embrace between the mother and son, "Thank God! you're okay..., my son." Arlen backed from it and she gave him a kiss on his forehead. "I heard of your valor at the red river, my son. You've made us proud." Arlen's mind starting flashing the battle in his head, the cries of the wounded, the pleads for mercy from the younger soldiers, and the boy he tried to spare, he kept a smile on his face as his sisters came to greet him. 

Julian stood on the upper floor watching all of it. He looked at him when he was greeted by the younger brothers ,when he crossed the courtyard and hugged his mother, a mixture of envy and somewhat hate as well in chest, yet his face calm, not giving any expression. "So the worthy heir returns victorious", he whispered to himself before turning away from the balcony. 

"Brother!" Victoria smiled, as Arlen hugged her, Julia and Leyla also followed along. Theron, standing near the entrance of the gallery, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword , in a teasing tone, "Come on, let us breath now, the young prince has been on his horse for weeks, unless you want to tire him to a collapse here and with your hugs and kisses."

A brief laughter ran through them as they climbed the steps and walked through the door. Eran walking close to Arlen, Arlen's arm resting on his shoulder.

***

White sprinkled as night fell over Zevaragrad, lamps glowing from the windows of houses and towers throughout the city, as the cool breeze blew across, flapping the banner. The streets noisy during the day, going quite and calm as the night cloaked over the land. The thin crescent peeked through the clouds.

The Royal dinner hall at the palace lit up bright by the lamps, candles and a large chandelier at the centre, throwing lines of gold and grey across the hall. At the edge of the long table sat King Theron, strong cold presence his gaze covering all who were present, with Queen Veyra, warm presence, her gaze full of warmth for her children, on his side.

Arlen was seated on King's left, thinking about what happened a few days ago at the battle and about the people Darius was sent to slay, with Eran beside him, young, proud, eyes full of youthful light. 

Across the table, on the right of the Queen, one seat was empty that belonged to Darius who was south shedding blood, on the next sat Prince Julian sits, fingers drumming the table as he gave small but sharp smiles, with him, Torren, another young boy who still has to see the true cruelty of the world . 

The seat next to Eran was also which belonged to Maria Zevaran. On the next ones , Victoria with her quick glances, Leyla with her eyes noticing everything and Julia in a calm and relaxed mood, were seated.

The servants were placing the plates and bowls on the table with roasted meat, soup and pouring in the beverage in the wooden cups. One lady servant pouring the beverage in Arlen's cup, her gaze on him, "Do you want anything else my Prince?", Arlen gestured a thankful no. The girl along with the others backed off from the table as everyone was served.

Conversations murmured among the family, the King and Queen discussing things, small laughter was shared, the sisters with their gossips, Eran and Arlen's warm discussions. After taking a sip of the beverage, Arlen, his face alight with a smile, clapped a hand on Eran's back, "So, how're the archery lessons going? I bet you torment Master Anton well."

Eran, after swallowing the bite he just took, an innocent smile, "Great..., I've learnt a lot, yesterday I shot two moving targets, on a horseback," his tone full of pride, as he lifted the cup and chugged in the brew.

Arlen's eyes widen with a proud smile on his face, "You're getting better by the day..., I'd love to see you shoot em down," as he sipped the brew from the cup.

Eran gulped down the liquid, a warm breath left his mouth before saying, "That'll be the day I ride beside you, instead of watching you leave from the courtyard," Eran wiped the brew from his lips as words poured out.

His mouth widened with a smile revealing his teeth, "I hope that day arrives soon..., wouldn't want to strike without a seasoned shooter beside me," he brushed quickly his fingers through Eran's hair.

Eran smiled wide with excitement and pride. Queen Veyra's lips widened seeing the warmth between brothers, Julian's eyes flickered between the table and Arlen, his mouth also displayed a small warm gesture. Theron face usually rigid and cold also cracked a smile, as he brought the spoon near his lips filled with soup.

Victoria leaned toward the table, her gaze at Eran, "Perhaps, you'll even outshine your brother that day ," her brows gesturing towards Arlen.

Arlen with half a laugh looked at Victoria, "It'll make me be more than happy, sister," as he took a bite from the roasted deer meat, "Maybe he'll outshine all of us," he gave a pat on Eran's back. Victoria smiled as she took a sip from the cup.

Torren after finishing his soup, lifted the cup to take a sip, his gaze turned at Arlen, "Brother..., can you tell us about how you broke the enemy at the red river? Eighty thousand men don't just give up and run." 

Arlen, with the meat near his lips was about to speak, until King Theron, with pride in his tone, joined in, "Your brother flanked them from behind..., where they least expected it. He led a fifteen thousand strong cavalry to charge in on them, breaking their backs, and the rest, was done by the men, on the other side of their lines." 

Eran looked at Arlen with pride and admiration.

Torren's eyes widening with admiration, but still curiosity lingering in there, "So were you scared? When you charged them?" 

"No..., not really, I rather enjoyed when we rode over the ridge."

Victoria, leaning in, her gaze toward Arlen, smile on her face ,"You do scare half of us when you ride out the courtyard." 

Arlen, turning his head toward Victoria, smiling back, "You worry too much..., I've ridden for half a dozen or more battles and, came back alive," he gestures the servant to pour in more beverage in his cup, as he continues, "I think you should concern more for the enemies than me,"  he took a sip as the servant backed off after filling the cup.

Leyla, smiling, with a teasing tone, "Even if you win a hundred battles and command half of the world's armies, you'll still our baby brother," A small laughter ran across the table, Arlen tightened his mouth as he turned his gaze to Veyra. The queen smirked.

He let out a breath before turning his gaze back to Leyla, his brows furrowed, an irritated tone in his voice, "You know sister, I'm just two years younger than you."

Leyla brought the cup near his lips, her eyes on the table, "Still counts..., You're smaller."

Theron with a grin on his face, brows lifted for a moment, "Fair point."

Arlen turned to his father, a bit of a surprised look on his face, jaw dropped a bit, "Father..., you too...?"

Julian with a smirk, putting his cup down, leaning back in his chair, "And now you whine like a baby."

Torren, Eran and the sisters , all of them started to laugh, Veyra and Theron gaze meeting each other's before looking at their children. Arlen leaning back in his seat, with a bit of an embarrassment on his face, arms crossed. His gaze at window just across the hall.

The mood freshened a bit in the hall, for a moment none of them spoke, until Julia broke the silence, "Father..., Darius hasn't arrived yet, is he still in the south?" curiosity and worry in her tone.

Arlen's jaw tightened, his gaze turning into a glare. Theron's face grew serious, Veyra's smile faded as she saw Arlen's face reacting to Julia's question.

Theron looked at Julia, voice deep and cold, "Yes daughter..., he's in the south finishing off the ones left behind after the battle, soon none of them will be left breathing."

Arlen couldn't hold the words in for long, his eyes closed for a moment, he opened them along with a breath, looking at his father, "Many innocents will die, who have nothing to do with the acts, of their elders... many women will die with the unborn in the womb."

Julian stared at Arlen, his lips tightened before words poured from his mouth, "Brother..., they are the blood of the ones who rose against the state, and the ones you cut down, during the battle." pointing with his spoon toward Arlen. Theron didn't react as the two brothers bantered, he watched silently. 

Arlen's fingers curled into a fist, eyes sharpened as they turned toward Julian, voice sharp, " The young should not be made accountable for the actions their elders take, they don't have a part in this, who has seen tomorrow?" his brows furrowing even more, "We're just slaughtering them in fear of what might happen years later," He let out a breath, "Not always the young turn out to be like their fathers, maybe they would have served the crown when they grew up, maybe even better than their elders could have."

Julian laced his fingers before his mouth, elbows resting on the table, voice deeper and colder, "Blood remembers brother, you kill someone's father today, they'll remember it for years before coming back after you." 

Queen Veyra looked at Julian then Arlen, she felt the tension growing. 

Victoria, rolled her eyes, "Here we go again," she whispered silently, only she could here it.

 "That doesn't mean you kill them today,..."

 "They share the blood of traitors..."

Arlen lost his temper completely, "**THEY’RE INNOCENT CHILDREN AND INFANTS WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS!**"  he cried, tone hard and furious, voice loud enough to fill the hall, even the servants became nervous seeing the prince angry. Eran and Torren locking gaze for a moment, their eyes wide, the sisters sat quiet as their eyes switched between Arlen and Julian.

He then paused, let out a breath, "They now face the same damn fate as the rebels, just because we fear they'll rise against us tomorrow," he added, this time with a lower voice.

Julian, with his voice also louder this time, "Perhaps if you hadn't become so weak, you should've seen the world different, than you see it now, the way it has to be seen..."

Arlen's jaw tightened, his glare sharpening even more, he was about to fire back, but Queen Veyra interrupted, her hand slapped hard on the table, "**ENOUGH...**, **ENOUGH...** both of you. Blood has been shed outside in the battlefield, don't turn the palace into one."

Arlen leaned back into his seat, his gaze at the window across the hall to his right.

Julian's face in that same cold expression, in a teasing tone like adding fuel to the fire, "Perhaps mister perfect should think about pouring wisdom about mercy, especially after he slaughtered children himself during the war south."

Arlen looked at Julian, his mouth almost letting words through, but he stopped, took a breath and stood up. "Excuse me...," as he stepped out of his seat and walked away toward the door. 

Eran locked gaze with Veyra for a moment, before he also stepped out of his seat and followed Arlen out of the hall as it became silent under the echo of their boots and both of them walked out, one after the other.

***

The gallery was lit up by the lamps and torches, silent but only the sound of Arlen's boots echoing across as he strolled through. The guilt of a crime he didn't even do grew in his heart. His hands crossed behind his back, head down, despair in the eyes.

Mind flashing everything that had happened in last three years, from leaving the Capital, the war of the Tibet, the battles with the Nalanda, the guilt of killing a boy and a girl in front of their mother as he looked into her eyes, the Kantari, the battle at the Red River, to his convo with Theron at the way back, the news of Darius going south and shedding blood and of course, his sudden burst in front of his family.

It wasn't just him showing anger because Julian teased him, it was the guilt of the children he killed during the war, the sorrow of the people being slaughtered at the south, the boy Darius killed in front of him, the young soldiers who pleaded for mercy but were sliced to death from the throat. 

He stopped by the balcony and leant on a pillar, staring down at the courtyard lit up by the lamps, he looked up at the dark sky filled with stars peeking through the clouds.  He watched the as the snow kissed the floor of the yard.

The silence didn't last long as footsteps approached, echoing across the gallery, he turned around only to see his younger brother Eran heading towards him.

"You always wonder off like that when you're upset.", his tone soft and boyish as he slowed down and leant to the pillar opposite to Arlen.

"I wasn't upset..., I just needed some time by myself. You know..., all that bloodshed and fighting and...," he stuttered a bit, swallowed and continued, "It can be too much of a noise, for a man to let in," a tint of tiredness maybe exhaustion in his voice as he spoke his heart out, his gaze down toward the courtyard, "And yes when there is someone like Julian at home, who always finds a way to annoy you," letting a breath out, "It gets overwhelming sometimes."

Eran looking at Arlen, his voice soft, "Well it's written all over your face when you're upset, I know Julian's words made you angry. He sure knows how to get on your nerves." 

Arlen gave a smile, gaze still down at the yard, "Yes..., he sure does..."

Eran in a curious tone, "You're mad at father as well, right? Him sending Darius south..."

Arlen closed his eyes, letting out a sigh, opening and turning them toward Eran, still leaning on the pillar, "I'm angry not at father," he turned his gaze toward the stars above , "He has his own way of handling things, the one which I also used to follow, maybe that's what a king truly requires, using fear and power to keep the people obeying them," He clenched his jaw as he looked down.

Eran straightened, rested his both arms on the porch railing, "And now you think those things can be done differently, that's why you and Darius are now at odds," He turns his gaze to Arlen.

Arlen, keeping his gaze down at the light falling at the yard-floor, "Darius, I don't know what happened to him, ever since I was named heir, his behaviour toward me changed, like... I took something from him. Even at the Red River when father praised me, his face looked like I wasn't his brother, instead some low life, who is being praised by the king instead of him."

Eran, tilting his head slightly, "Well, I think you should ask yourself if father did the same thing to you, how would you feel...?" his brow frowned in curiosity.

Arlen's eyes sharpened as he looked at Eran, "What do you mean by that?"

Eran answered without hesitating, " Like, if you were raised believing the throne belonged to you, and then father chose me or Torren as heir because, he liked something in us, would you love me,  or him the same? Like you do now?"

Arlen's sharpened eyes relaxed and widened, he had no actual no answer for the question his little brother asked.

Eran leaned toward him, lifting one of his brows, "Would you?"

Arlen didn't know what to say for a moment, "Look, Eran...," he straightened, stepped closer and put his hand or Eran's shoulder, "No throne, power or position will be more for me than you two. In fact you're the only one who doesn't see me a brother who was chosen as a successor to a long list of rulers," he brushed his fingers slowly in Eran's hair, "If this happened I would have happily accepted it, because if I know one thing more thing anything else."

Eran tilted his head slightly, in a curious tone, "And what's that?"

Arlen smiled, "If anyone in the kingdom thinks exactly like me, it's you and If I'd like to see anyone on that damn throne other than me, It'll be you because, if there is anyone after mother who I trust, it's you," he swallowed as he looked down for a moment, let a breath through, "Always remember this... I'll never even think of harming you , and if I do, May the wrath of God fall upon me and I be damned." he said as he looked at Eran before he brought him closer for a warm embrace, Arlen swallowed as he closed his eyes.

Eran also wraps his arms around his brother, who he knows is a safe place for him even if the world goes against them.

***

**The next day...**

Pale sunlight fell over the City of Zevaragrad, leaves rustling as wind blew. The air now colder after the last night's sprinkle. Streets filled with hush as the local roamed around, going on stalls, workshops. 

The woman slowed down as her eyes caught the sight of a beautiful red-silk, she turned toward the merchant's shop. Coming to a halt just by the stand, she took a look at the fabric ,as she asked, "How much for this one?" she rubbed her fingers, holding the cloth. 

"That'll be ten silver coins, my lady."

The woman began to bargain, she placed the silk where she took it from, and moved on to the next stall as the deal wasn't made.


At the royal palace, the throne room was starting to get filled by the courtiers and the military generals, as Theron had sent word of holding court. Sunlight creeping through the long windows, spraying streaks of white and grey across the hall. The violet banners of the Zevarans, with the pheonix sigil on them, hung motionless from the ceiling and against the walls.

King Theron, wearing the dark crown shaped in the wings of the Pheonix, his throne as well in shape of the flaming wings of the bird. The head of the rearing bird rose behind the seat, the King sat on, his dark drapes spilt over the carved feathers. His assertive gaze covering the hall crowded with generals in their tarnished armour, robed courtiers, each of them gathered to witness judgement and reward.

Theron started the court with the formal greeting, then took a pause before he said, "Today we honour the ones who stood firm at the Battle of the Red River, against the treacherous Kantari, who dared lay sword at the King."

At the right side of the dais, just a few feet away, stood Arlen along with his younger brothers, his hand resting on the hilt of his blade, his gaze locked at Theron as he spoke. 

Across the room, equal to Arlen stood Julian, in his cold, emotion less expression, hand tied in front him, looking at his father as he delivered his words.

Theron, continued to speak as the entire court had their gaze locked on him, "Let the Red River be an example for those who seek to rise against the throne, those who wish to overthrow the King," his tone assertive and cold.

Arlen couldn't help but think of the slaughter as Theron mentioned them being an example, he tried to hide the emotions as his jaw clenched, he let out a sigh.

Theron turned his gaze toward Arlen, "Arlen Zevaran, step forward," he gestured with his hand.

The court room was silent, Arlen's boot echoed his steps as he walked a few feet from his position and halted in front of the King, just paces away from the dais. Arlen knelt down, his one knee on the ground, and one levelled with his jaw, with his hand resting on it, head bowed down.

 "Stand..."

Arlen stood up, with his gaze turned at the King, and hands tied in front.

"As the Zevaran tradition, of rewarding the ones who stood up for their King in hard times, for your valor and a brilliant strategic move in battle, I name you, Arlen Zevaran, hero of the Red River."

Eran and Torren looked at each other with a proud smile, watching their brother being rewarded in front of a number of courtiers and generals.

Julian's lips tightened, as his eyes turned toward the ground for a moment before looking at Arlen.

Arlen slightly squinted his eyes, he swallowed as his jaw tightened.

Theron looked at Arlen, "As a reward for your bravery, I give you not just a title, but...," his voice raised, "Fifty thousand men under your command, archers, infantry and cavalry, along with some of our best commanders, Commander Nikolai, Commander Rodion, Commander Trifon, and Commander Sergei, at your disposal."

Julian looked at his father as his eyes glared, he couldn't believe Arlen being rewarded with a proper unit under his command. Nikolai not looking much happy at the King's decision. A small murmur rushed through the court between the officials. 

Eran leaned back toward Torren, voice low enough so only his brother could hear, "One day I'll join them as well."

Torren grinned as he patted Eran's back, "You will indeed, brother." he said in a whisper. Eran straightened with a smile.

Rodion and Trifon shook hands as delight ran through them after being assigned under the Prince's command, who trained with them, growing up. Trifon was proud because Arlen was his student. Sergei didn't give much reaction, he saw it as duty, being assigned by the King, not as a source of pleasure.

Theron, after finishing his brief speech about the battle looked at Arlen, "May you lead them well," with a nod, not of King, but a father this time, he smiled as he gestured Arlen to move back to his position.

Arlen's lips widened with a smile, he smiled back at his father, as he turned back to move to his place along side his brothers.

They both waited as Arlen stepped back, and when he was close enough Eran edged his hand out, fingers curled, palm upward, when Arlen saw it he gave a smile, while he halted and turned he dropped his hand, and their palms clashed in a quite slap, Torren locked gaze with Arlen while he turned, Arlen gave him a wink, he almost grinned but as they were in court and couldn't act casual and boyish, they straightened their faces back to normal.

Commander Trifon looked at Arlen from across the room, Arlen noticed his teacher, they both nodded with a smile, pride in the teacher's eyes, delight in the student's eyes.

Queen Veyra seated at the dais, beside Theron saw the warm moment between brothers and their straightening their faces, she gave a warm smile, knowing Arlen is not completely alone without her. 

Theron, after he finished addressing, "That will be all," he gestured the officials present there to leave.

The court started to empty as the generals walked out, the commanders assigned to Arlen came to him, congratulating the Prince, Trifon, proudly, Rodion like an elder brother ,as they both hugged the Prince, Nikolai with a forced smile on his face, and Sergei, ,formally, nodded as they shook hands with him.

***

The courtiers were leaving the courthall, murmurs echoing across. Some had smiles on their faces, others who envied the Prince, their faces showing clearly displaying what was inside as they discussed, "He's still a boy..., The King grants him so much power, first made him heir over Prince Darius, now gave him his own personal force," one of the officials said.

The other added, "And now the best of the generals are under his command," he narrowed his eyes as he spoke quickly, "Do you think they will like this?".

"Well, he is a Prince... all must follow his word".

"The King trusts him too much."

One of the friends of Trifon, who admired Arlen heard them gossiping about the prince, he walked toward them, "My Fellow noblemen, don't forget it is Prince Arlen who crushed the Kantari rebellion", he gestured with two fingers, "He helped win the War of Tibet just a few months ago, if the Kings grants him, it is because he deserves it."

The courtiers tightened their lips as they nodded, a fake smile on their faces.

Just as Arlen was about to walk toward the door, a figure appeared, blood on his cloak, boots covered with mud, scars of war over his face, none other than the ruthless Prince Darius. Arlen's smile faded as he saw him, his relaxed gaze turned into a glare.

A hush ran through the hall as everyone froze in their places as they saw Darius walk in. His boots echoed in silence, his cold gaze at his father sitting at the throne, in his hand a wet leather sack, swinging gently as he stepped ahead.

A few paces from the dais he halted and swung his the leather sack open, tossing a severed head of a Kantari Lord, rolled for a few inches on the floor before coming to rest, spilling blood along with it. Its eyes half open and jaw loosened.

Everyone gasped with their eyes wide opened, the courtiers murmured. 

Theron with a brief smile on his face, looked at Darius as if saying, "Well done my son," just through eye contact.

Torren's eyes wide opened, his jaw dropped, he froze in his place. Eran closed his eyes shut as he held onto Arlen so tightly his knuckles were white.

Arlen's mouth opened, half showing his teeth, jaw tightened eyes sharp as he looked at the severed head and then at Darius.

Darius turned his gaze toward Arlen, gesturing with his sword at the head, "That's how you answer to treason," his tone as he was trying to humiliate his brother in front of the court.

Julian smirked as Darius taunted Arlen in front of everyone.

Arlen looked Darius in the eyes, fire in his own, his fingers curling into fist.
