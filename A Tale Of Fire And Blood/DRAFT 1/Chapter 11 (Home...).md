# Chapter 11 (Home...)


**Five days later, 30th Glacivar, 1701 AC.**


The wooden wheels of the carriages creaked as it strolled over the road. The walls of city just ahead now. They had now finally reach the outskirts of the Capital after days of travelling. Two guards rode at front with Arlen between them slightly behind followed by the rest of the people.
Fredrick straightened his back as his gaze lingered on the high towers of the Capital, his head also lifted as the corner of his lip curved. Eran let out a sigh, he was now waiting for the journey to end due to his tiredness.

Inside the Princess' carriage voices of the three of them echoed as they chattered and giggled. Maria had been noticing Elaria and Arlen during their travel to the capital, especially the couple of days they took to get back to being normal after the Arlen's falter at the inn. She had been talking about him with Elaria but not exactly mentioning what had been between them.

Jason who rode beside Eran slowed down his horse to get near the carriage. Senara noticed him through the window getting close. He looked at her and with a smile on his face he said, "We're here..., the Capital of Zevaria." 

Senara took her head out of the window and turned around to look at the City. The broad walls and the high towers got closer by the moment. She moved inside and gestured to Elaria. Elaria then also looked out at the walls from the window and saw the very heart of Zevaria, the lands where her mother belonged to. 

The guards at the guarding towers of the city shouted, "THEY HAVE ARRIVED." And the gates of the city creaked as the soldiers pushed them open. All of their eyes on the Prince or on the carriages with the Dawngard sigil on them. Arlen looked at the ones standing beside the gates and nodded with a smile on his face. They answered to the nod with a respectful bow to the heir. 

The hooves of their mounts clapped against the ground as they crossed the gates. Jason and Fredrick's eyes moved around as they gazed at the walls and the streets of the city they had now came to years later. It was a feeling similar to returning home as they had spent years in the Capital growing up. 

The people saw the princes' arrive and had gathered on the sides of the road. Arlen and Eran nodded to the people as they bowed. Apart from that both of them didn't bother more about what was happening. The chants and shouts of people hailing didn't catch their attention as they only sought to reach the Palace.

Elaria and Senara watched from inside the cart, they looked at the booming streets of the Capital. Traders and merchants could be heard making their calls to the people, selling the goods. Elaria looked at the buildings outside, there was a entangled feeling of comfort and suffocation. She saw the people, how they looked at Arlen and praised him. She now was assured he was popular and loved by local people. 

Maria felt the comfort of her home, arriving after years. Her mouth curved to a smile as they closed in on the Palace. 

The echoes of the hooves silenced as the horses halted in front of the Royal Palace's gates. The guards opened the gates leading to the courtyard. Julian stood on the other side along side their sisters, Victoria, Julia and Leyla. Victoria's eyes widened as they caught at Fredrick as he dismounted his horse. She barely stopped herself from running toward him.

Arlen looked at Jason and let out a heavy sigh. He gestured to the guard to open the carriages for the guests. The young man nodded and followed the Prince's order. He swung the door open and Azekial stepped out. His gaze rigid and cold looking at the surroundings. Arlen politely gestured him with a smile to enter the Palace. He curved his lips though only to show the Prince and walked toward the courtyard. 

Helene and Lilly now also had came out to watch the guests arrive. She looked at Arlen as he opened the door of the second carriage. Maria stepped out first holding her brother's hand. Helene's brows furrowed as she saw Arlen smiling for someone else to come out. She wondered, _Who could that be?_  Elaria stepped out, and held Arlen's hand. Helene's heart raced as she saw the Prince whom she had been dying for holding another women's hand. Lilly held her arm tight as she knew what this meant for Helene.

Leyla looked at the envoy and his cold expressions as he entered the courtyard. _What a....._ She didn't like the arrogant way he walked across the courtyard. Julian greeted the envoy, with a smile on his face he said, "Greetings, Father will meet you tomorrow in the court." Leyla's lips curved as she embraced the fact that Theron wanted the enemy envoy to wait until the next day to meet. Looking at the way Azekial walked toward them strengthened her feeling.

Julia had been looking at Arlen and the way he lent his hand to Elaria. She had noticed the controlled smile of her brother as he followed the guest ladies toward them. Seemed this wasn't a secret to her also now.

Queen Veyra had now came out as well, Maria strode across the courtyard and both of them embraced. "It's been so long.... since we've seen you, I've been looking forward for your arrival," she said in a warm voice with a smile.

"I also had been waiting to come back." 

Maria then met her sisters and all those years she hadn't been home seemed to have vanished away now. 

Victoria ran toward Fredrick as he approached and both of them embraced. "What a surprise!!! I didn't know you were coming," both of them loosened the embrace and she placed her hand on his cheek. "You should have at least sent a letter to tell me."

Fredrick held her hand and answered, "Your brother told me that would ruin it all if I tell you."

Victoria looked at Arlen who approached from behind. He looked at her and tilted his head. She then rushed toward him and embraced her brother.

"I thought this was the least I could do for you, sister." 

Both then let go of the embrace. Arlen then walked ahead and met his mother. Elaria and Senara followed behind. Julian looked at Arlen and nodded with a smile, both the brothers embraced. Julian looked at the lady guests and asked, "Who are these young ladies?"

Arlen let out a slight sigh, "This is Lady Elaria Aelvan...." he gestured politely toward Elaria as she nodded. "The daughter of Cassimar Aelvan, she will be our guest along with Lord Azekial." He then pointed at Senara, "And she... is lady Senara, Elaria's friend."

Queen Veyra looked at the young girls and greeted them. Julian nodded at the ladies before they met with Arlen's sisters. 

While this was happening Arlen's gaze lingered on the balcony for a couple moments. It was Darius who stood there alongside his wife and son who had arrived back a few days ago from her home. He watched as his family greeted Arlen and the guests. Arlen's gaze then jumped toward Helene and Lilly who stood by the gallery pillars. Helene and Arlen gaze met for a couple of moments but the Prince didn't notice what was going on there. For him it was just a glance at a servant. But for Helene it was huge. When Arlen looked away she turned around and went inside, followed by Lilly.

The Queen then gestured the guests to come inside. She ordered the servants to lead them to their rooms. Victoria and Fredrick chattered and giggled as they went inside. Jason's gaze met with Senara before he was asked by Eran to come with him. Arlen whispered to Julian, "Where is father?" 

"He's in his room," Julian whispered back. Arlen gave Julian a soft pat on the back as he walked toward his father's room. 

The guests had now reached the Capital. Months and weeks of travel had now finally came to an end. For the spies it was the beginning of the duty and for those who shared heart a moment of warmth and joy.

***

The cold dusk bid it's farewell for the day as the night cloaked over. Lamps and torches lit up across the Capital and in the Royal Palace. Arlen stood by the balcony just a few paces from the dinner hall. Cold wind brushed on his face as he watched the darkening sky. After speaking with his Father he was at peace, at least for that day. 

But that was not the only thing he was wondering about there in solitude. His mind also flashed the couple weeks he spent on the road with the guests. That time was enough to turn that single glance at Fredrick's house into something deeper. His mouth curved at the thought of Elaria and him sharing those moments along the road home.

Footsteps approached from just a few paces away, breaking the silence around the Prince. Arlen turned to look who it was coming his way. It was his sister Maria. Her hand holding the other in front. She looked at her brother with a soft and warm smile. Arlen's brows furrowed as his lips curved up as well. 

"Looks like you're hungrier than any of us today...," she said, halting beside Arlen. "You've been standing here since you came out from father's room."

He looked at the stars above, "Yes..., the long road does make you hungry...," Arlen answered in a polite voice.

Maria looked down at the courtyard, she asked, "What did father say?"

"Nothing much...," he tightened his lips before speaking again. "He asked about the guests and Azekial." Arlen then turned toward Maria, "You didn't meet him? He was waiting for you."

"I met him after you left his chamber, he was happy to see me," she paused to take a breath. "It's been long since he's seen my face."

Arlen nodded with a smile, "Yes..., doesn't matter how he is as a king. He's still our father."

"He loves us all."

Arlen nodded.

Both of them looked at the lower gallery across the yard below. Arlen saw Elaria and Senara walking toward the stairs. She didn't notice the Prince staring at her from above, both of them were chattering and giggling among themselves.

Arlen swallowed as he looked at her. Maria looked at him and saw the way his face lit up seeing her. She leaned toward him, and whispered, "She will also be joining us for dinner."

Arlen turned his gaze at Maria, his eyes narrowed and lips loosened. He didn't say anything, just looked at her in curiosity.

"I talked to father to let our guests join us, she is a noble woman and half Zevarian." She paused and smiled. "Also I thought someone will like her being on the table with us," she whispered.

Arlen's heart raced, he took in a breath and let it out slowly. Maria grabbed her arm softly, "Come on don't worry..., you've already spent enough days with her on the road."

He nodded and they both walked toward the hall. The servants had already done placing everything in it's place before the dinner. Helene looked at him entering the hall with his sister. Their gaze met for a moment before Arlen took his seat. 

It was not long before Elaria entered with her friend. Arlen looked at her as she approached her seat. The young servant boy gestured her to take her seat. They both looked at each other and smiled. 

Arlen let out a sigh and asked her, "So..., how's the Palace and the city?"

She answered, "It's more beautiful than I thought. I've been hearing about it growing up."

He nodded and just as he was about to answer, Senara spoke up. "The carvings on the pillars and the doors caught our eyes actually, what are they actually. An eagle?"

"Oh..., you're talking about the Phoenix. An old legend actually..., something our ancestors used to believe in."

Helene watched him talk to the guests as she set up everything else in the hall. Her heart was racing as she heard them speak, but what could she do? The Prince she loved had already given her heart to the foreign visitor.

Just a few moments later Jason and Eran entered the hall. He looked at Senara and they both shared a smile. Both of them took their seats and their giggles and chatters now started to echo in the previously silent hall.

***

Soon after everyone else had arrived to the hall. The King and the Queen came at the last. They stood in respect for the royal couple. Theron gestured everyone to sit down. The hall was filled with echoes of spoons clanking with the bowls and pouring of the beverage. Everyone had their share of the food. 

Maria after swallowing the bite looked at Theron and said, "Father...," Theron looked at her before she continued. "I told you about our guests."

Theron nodded, "Ah Yes...," he looked at Elaria, "My daughter told me your mother was from Zevaria."

Elaria put her hand in front her mouth as she swallowed the bite. Her gaze met Arlen's before looking Theron. She answered, "Yes your highness..., she was taken from the Isles during the war."

Theron added, "Ah the war of the Crimson Sea. We did hear the Azlari soldiers taking captives."

Elaria nodded, "Yes your highness. She was one of them."

Theron looked at Elaria's locket and his eyes slightly narrowed, _This looks familiar._ He asked, "Your mother..., tell us about her. Who was she? If she was from Zevaria we better know her."

"Her name was Miraya..., she died when I was three...," she paused as her gaze with Theron broke. "Anything else from that..., I don't know your highness."

The name Miraya did rang some bells in Theron's head, maybe also Veyra's also. But they didn't spoke about that. The name was indeed familiar to them.

Veyra asked, "Do you have anything that reminds you of her?"

"Yes your highness. This...," Elaria grabbed her locket and showed it to them, "This belonged to my mother."

The King and Queen looked at the locket and it also was something they were familiar of. But they chose not to speak yet.

Julian who had been silent all along during the dinner now chose to speak. He put spoon down and looked at Elaria. He asked, "We all know Azlari and Zevarans struggle to keep mutual peace. Like you discussed with my Father. They took the Shinobi Isles from us during the Crimson Sea war."

Elaria nodded politely, she knew from Julian's tone he wasn't polite like Arlen or Eran. She chose to listen first what the Prince wanted to say. Arlen's turned his gaze on the table as Julian spoke. He let out a sigh.

Julian continued, " So..., my lady tell us, why did Oristane send an envoy? Especially during this team when everything is actually peaceful between the two Empires. If that wasn't enough the First Councillor's daughter also came."

Arlen looked at Julian as he asked this. His gaze then turned toward Elaria and met her. Not long before it broke and as she was about to speak Maria answered to Julian. "I think we should wait for tomorrow's court, the envoy himself can tell us the reason of this."

Darius looked at Maria and he also joined. "I think Julian is right, sister. We should at least know something..., since the guests have joined us for dinner."

Arlen held his forehead with his fingers. He knew they weren't wrong either, he might also have done the same if she hadn't caught his heart. He chose to remain silent.

Elaria looked at Arlen before turning to Darius. She answered, "Your highness..., you're right to doubt, after all that has happened between the two Empires. The King only wants the relations to get better. And..., as for my arrival here, I think it's best that I answer that in court tomorrow."

Arlen's lip curved into a faint smile, his gaze still down. Even though someone from outside, but still did silenced Julian and Darius without creating any havoc. He looked at her and they met gaze, this time noticed by Queen Veyra. She saw the way he looked at her.

Theron who was silent during this and saw how she handled both his sons. He was about to speak, but Veyra spoke. "I think that's enough politics for now. Let the guests have their dinner."

Eran knew what state his brother was in as he had been on the road with him. He chose the right moment and said, "Father..., why don't you tell the guests how Arlen crushed the Kantari rebellion."

_Oh for the love of...._ Darius didn't like Eran speaking about Arlen's role in the battle of Red River.

Theron's mouth widened to a smile. His said in a proud tone, "Yes..., you're right my son. They should know about the recent battle we've fought against the rebels." He then sang songs of how Arlen used his tactics to outmanoeuvre the rebels. Arlen for once didn't get caught in the guilt he was all this time. He looked at the envious face of Darius and sat calmly as Theron told the guests about the battle.

Elaria who had already heard about Arlen's victory at Dharan during her travel now got to hear another and more recent accomplishment of the Prince. They both kept sharing glances during that. 

No matter how Darius was against Arlen, he wouldn't dare speak out his father in front of a guest. Even though he wanted to say but he couldn't. He just sat their with his jaw and fists tightened. After Theron ended, it was not long for the dinner to be concluded as well.

Elaria after asking from Senara said, "Your Highness..., We've been on the road for weeks. If you let us..., we want to head to our chambers and get some rest."

Theron nodded and gestured with his hand. Both of them then rose from their seats and walked out of the dinner hall.

***

The gallery felt even more quieter after leaving the hall. A few young servants could be seen down in the courtyard running across, maybe for some work. The faint moonlight fell on the floor of the courtyard and on the roof of the Palace. Their shoes echoed politely as they strode across the gallery. Elaria and Senara gazed on the pillars and walls lit by the gold from the lamps and torches.

Just a few moments after, Jason along with Fredrick and Eran also came out from the door. Jason was about to follow them but Fredrick gestured him to not go. "Not yet..., give them some time," he said. Arlen approached from behind, he put his elbow on Jason's shoulder. 

He gestured about what happened. Fredrick pointed with his brows toward the guests. Arlen looked at them both walking away and whispered, "We'll talk to them later, let them breathe for now." They then went away toward their chambers. The echoes of their shoes slowly fainted in the quiet of the gallery.

Across the gallery, in the silence of the night, the guests halted along the balcony. Elaria leant on the pillar and gazed up at the moon. It wasn't a full one but enough to be seen. Senara took the one just opposite to Elaria. She said in a low voice, "This one knows how to speak well."

Elaria smirked and answered, "Yes... It seems all of their tongues as sharp as the swords they carry."

"And you saw the way their King just used the chance to sing about their battles."

Elaria nodded. She let out a sigh and then answered, "Yes..., they seem pretty proud of their victories."

Senara gave an eye to the empty gallery behind her friend and then said, "Is he also like this?"

Elaria furrowed her brows, "What do you mean?"

"I mean the heir, you two spoke a lot when he rode here. Is he also like them? Trying to drag in his victories."

Elaria shook her head, "No..., he's..., shy. He seems different from them."

"You like him don't you?"

Elaria looked at her, "What makes you think that?"

Senara replied, "I've seen you two, and..., the way you look at him as well."

Elaria didn't answer, she turned her gaze toward the courtyard below.

Senara gave her a pat on the back, "Come on..., say it you like him."

Elaria smiled and answered, "Well..., maybe a little. But not that much." She looked at Senara, "What about you? You also seemed pretty moved by friend."

"Ah yes..., he's kind off funny..."

"You two will make a perfect couple." Elaria said in a teasing tone, controlling her laugh.

Senara gave her a light slap on the arm, "Shut up..."

Both of them giggled before a few moments of silence.

Senara broke it and said, "And..., the mission."

"Yes..., Father told me every month a ship arrives at Dawngard. Traders travel from there to a city just a few miles South from here...," she paused for a moment to remember the name of the city. "Yes..., Elmorne. He called it Elmorne."

"How much is it from here?" Senara asked.

"I don't know..., but Father said they reach the city almost every five or six weeks. He told me the one we need to give the details will arrive here himself."

"Azekial might know him."

"Yes..., he will show us the man a day before he leaves."

Senara nodded. She across the gallery at the entrance of the hall. Queen Veyra and Maria stood there, talking. She then looked at Elaria, "You think they will accept us staying here? That's the first thing right?"

"Yes..., they will. All we need is Azekial to convince their king for the terms. If he accepts those, then accepting us making a trading stop here." Elaria answered.

Senara nodded. "But what about their heir and his friend? What will we do with them?"

"They will not doubt us. Even if anyone suspects they'll likely fend them off. And for what is between us and them. Let it go along as it is."

Senara nodded. "Let's try not to fall further for these idiots."

Elaria smirked, "Yes..."

Both of them then shook hands and then walked toward their chamber. Their footsteps fainted in the gallery's cold hush. But Senara wasn't the only to see across the hall. Maria and Queen Veyra also saw them standing on the balcony and then stride away.

She walked slowly by her mother in the gallery, their shadows casted by the gold of the lamps followed behind. Queen Veyra looked at the two girls. "You've spent days with them on the road. What do you think about them?" she asked Maria.

Maria answered in a low voice, "Apparently both of them seem nice. We had a good couple of weeks on the road. But something did seem strange. Maybe because they came to a new land or..."

"Or they are hiding something."

Maria nodded, "Yes it can be."

"And what about your brother. He seemed pretty charmed by this, Elaria," the Queen said.

"Yes..., mother. He likes the girl. But I've told him to be careful. After all she is from Azlarian court."

"Ah my son. Of all the girls here, you chose a foreigner." She then looked at Maria. "Try to keep an eye on these two. If they try to do something. Let me know."

Maria answered, "Yes mother. I'll put the servants on the job."

Both the mother and daughter's shoes echoes also faded into silence as they strode off. The spies even though trying their best to keep the cover. But still experience counts. One move could make them suspicious. The Queen and Princess were also right in their own manner, you just cannot trust a couple ladies from a rival nation to come and stay at your home without reason.

***

**Later that night...**

The room was lit by the torches, with the window keeping the cold breeze outside. It was quiet and peaceful compared to the dinner hall. Both Fredrick and Victoria finally had got a moment alone after a long time of being apart. They both sat on the side of the bed. His arm wrapped around her back. Her head rested on his shoulder. They gazed at the faint moonlight coming through the window.

"It's been a long three years...," Victoria said. "You don't know how I spent all that time."

Fredrick smiled and answered in a low voice, "I know..., it's been the same for me as well."

"Last time you came was before that war."

"I know and I wanted to come when we returned from the south but..., my Father wanted me back home so I had to go there."

Victoria answered in disappointed tone, "You could have sent a letter at least."

"We were in war..., I sent some when we left Sapphire Rock. You didn't get them?"

She nodded, "Yes..., I did get them, and prayed all of you return home safe. My Father, brothers and you."

Both of them straightened, he looked at her and said with a smile, "Well, at least I'm here now."

She looked in his eyes and answered, "But you're not staying."

Fredrick let out a sigh, "Yes..., I have to go home."

"But at least stay until bloomrise. We can get to celebrate spring together."

"I know Arlen said the same. But you know how it all works. I'm the eldest son and my Father needs me back."

She asked politely, "How many days?"

He titled his head, curving his lips. Then answered, "A week. Maybe nine or ten days at most."

Victoria said quickly as if in a hurry, "Let's run away and get married. Let's leave all this behind and start a new life. Somewhere far away from here."

"Your Father and Brothers will track down and kill us both if we do that, you know better. It's better if we marry with their will."

"Then what use will the Valdrek forces be?"

"We cannot go against the Zevarans themselves, or we will end up like the Kantari."

Victoria didn't say anything, she just nodded. Her face seemed like a flower wilted.

Fredrick grabbed her hand. He said, "Don't worry..., I'll go and talk to Father. He'll ask the King for your hand." He paused for a moment, then said, "The next time I come here it will probably along with my parents for your hand."

A rush ran across her as she jumped to embrace him. Her arms tightened around him, controlling a huge scream from happiness. Fredrick struggling to speak, managed utter a few words, "Well..., let's hope another war doesn't come in the way."

She then let go of the embrace and nodded. "Yes..., but when will you bring them here?"

"Maybe in the month of bloomrise."

"But you should promise this time."

"Yes..., yes..., I promise."

Both of them embraced one more time, not tight or sudden this time, rather a warm one.

"I should go now. It's late at night. You should also sleep. We got a court tomorrow, let's see what those Azlari have to offer to the king," he said. Victoria nodded.

Fredrick then stood up from the bed and walked toward the door. Politely opening it and closing it behind him. Victoria just stared at the window after he left. _Whatever happens..., let's just hope it's for the best._  

***

Those two were not the only ones who were sharing their heart out that night. Outside the chamber granted to the Azlari lady guests. It was almost a same situation. But here it was two boys who were discussing quietly who should go in the guest chamber first and call the lady out they admire. 

Jason whispered, "Forget it..., they might be asleep by now."

Arlen shook his head and answered, "No..., I saw them myself entering the room just a few moments ago. I think they went to the garden after the dinner then came back."

"In this cold?"

"Yeah..., you already seen them roam out of the inns we stopped at the road. Besides they wear their cloaks," Arlen whispered back.

"I don't know..., I don't think we sh...."

"Shut up..., you've ruined my sleep now we'll both go and talk to them," Arlen cut off Jason.

"But when did you see them coming to the room?" Jason asked.

"When you were splatting your face with water."

Jason nodded. He brought his hand ahead to knock on the door but halted. "You do it..."

Arlen let out a sigh, "Fine..., get aside."

He politely clapped his fist against the door. For a few moments nothing happened. Jason gestured they should go. Arlen shook his head and whispered, "Wait."

A few moments a voice came from inside, "Yes? Come in."

Arlen slowly pushed the door, the wood creaked as it swung open. Elaria and Senara were sitting on both their beds. Jason slowly stepped a couple paces back, trying not to be seen by them.

Arlen stepped in slowly, he looked at Elaria and said softly, "I'm...sure, we didn't ruin your sleep."

Elaria shook her head, "No..., not at all. We weren't sleeping anyways."

Senara looked at Elaria and she nodded. She then stood up and walked toward the door as she wrapped her cloak. She stepped out of the door. Arlen slowly closed it behind him as he stepped in. 

"Couldn't sleep?" Elaria asked.

"Actually I wanted to... ask if... you... didn't find anything troubling here," he stuttered. Elaria hardly controlled a giggle as she saw it. Arlen let out a breath and continued, "And..., I was sorry for what happened at dinnner. My brothers they are always...."

As he was speaking Elaria spoke, "No... it's okay. I can understand, as a Prince you are vigilant for anyone who comes like this to the palace."

She pulled back the blanket on the bed and gestured him to come and sit. He first looked at her and swallowed. Then nodded and went to sit beside her.

"Well..., I shouldn't have come here in the first place it has been a long journey for you both and you needed rest."

Elaria answered, "It's okay. We don't mind. Besides as guests we need someone to be here in the palace we can talk to without any fear."

Arlen nodded. "So how does it feel here? Coming to the heart of the lands your mother was from?" he asked.

"Feels..., strange if I'm being honest. But it does make me want her to be alive even more."

"I'm sorry."

She shook her head, "You don't have to."

He tightened his jaw then asked, "You didn't tell us how she died. I mean if it's a secret then okay I won't insist. But..., after all that time we've been together on the road, I think maybe there's no problem in ask...."

"She died when I was three. All I remember is standing outside the medics room and one maid came to me and said your mother is dead. I started crying and screaming, I ran inside toward her."

"How did she die?"

She shook her head, "I don't know, they say she was sick."

"Do you believe that?"

"Believe what?"

He tilted his head slightly and said, "You believe that she died from sickness and wasn't killed?"

Elaria didn't know what to say on that. She didn't saw this from such point of view her whole life. She wasn't also sure about the sickness but this was something that put doubt in her.

"Why would they kill her?"

"Maybe she had a secret that they got to know?"

"Everyone knew she was from Zevaria, what secret could she have apart from that."

"You're right. I'm sorry sometimes I just go too far ahead."

"I told you already..., you don't have to be sorry for anything. Don't apologize again for these little things."

He nodded, _Well that's nice_. Both of them stayed silent for a moment. Arlen then asked, "Tomorrow Father will have court. You're ready for that?"

"You know how things have been between our empires. I don't think he will accept our terms. And..., if he doesn't accept then we'll be leaving tomorrow."

"Why is that?" his brows furrowed.

"We will present him what our King told to. If your father accepts the offer then me and Senara would stay here for..., maybe six months or a year or two."

"What is that he won't accept?"

She thought for a few moments, _should I tell him right away before the court?_ 

Arlen narrowed his eyes as he looked into her eyes. "What happened?"

Elaria answered, "Nothing..., I just wanted to speak it all in court."

"You can trust me... I won't say anything before court. Besides I can tell right away if whatever you have to offer will be accepted or not," he said.

"Our King wants trade centres in Zevaria. That would be run by Azlari men appointed by my Father. And..., me and Senara will be appointed to the one here in the capital for a year or two." 

"And you fear he will reject them because?"

"Because they will be like Azlari posts in Zevaran territory. But we need them because the southern routes aren't safe and you know those lands."

"I don't know about being safe or not but yes the red road is the fastest way between the east and the west of Zevaria."

Elaria asked, "Will he accept?"

"Honestly..., no. Not with it being totally controlled by your people and them being in the Capital. My Father would never let you make those in Zevaragrad or in the Capital territory. Another city? Maybe yes."

She asked, "And?"

"And..., also he will not like the thought of those posts being run by Azlari men. He'll want Zevarian men to be in charge there, and you'd have to pay taxes for them as well."

"If we present these terms he will accept?"

He shook his head, "I can't say for sure. But these are closest you can get to getting accepted. And..., whatever terms you have apart from this. If they are good enough then he might accept this as well."

Elaria nodded, _Well this was easy._ She took a soft yawn. 

Arlen looked at her and said, "I think I should go now. You need rest."

Elaria nodded. He stood up and walked toward the door. "I'll see you tomorrow then after court." He slowly pulled the door open and stepped out as she stared at him. The spy had now something that would benefit them in the court next day. But along with that a flicker of doubt that had been put by the Prince in her heart about her mother's death.

***

**Meanwhile...**

While they were talking inside the room. There was also the same environment as well. When Arlen had gone in Senara came out. Jason stood there by the wall as she came out. He saw her and straightened. She also looked at him and they both smiled.

"What you're doing here?" She asked.

"Nothing..., the Prince wanted to have a word with the lady."

"It seems he isn't the only one," she said as she walked toward him.

"Well..., if I be honest.... I asked him to.... come. If that didn't disturb your sleep," Jason stuttered.

"No..., well actually Arlen said the same thing. We weren't sleep. You didn't disturb us, don't worry."

Jason gestured her to move first as they both stepped toward the balcony and leant on the pillars.

"So what do you think of the Capital? I mean it must've felt different from where you came from."

Senara nodded and replied, "Yes it is. Well if you talk about me I do have lived in a Capital but never seen a royal Palace from the inside before."

"Wait aren't you a noble woman? Like Elaria."

"No..., I'm just her friend. Actually we grew up together. We used to go to the same place for learning stuff. I've never been to the Palace."

Jason giggled, "It's funny actually we spent all those days talking and this never came up."

Senara smirked and nodded. "Well we were busy in other things on the way weren't we."

"It was a good journey, I wish we could have gotten more of it."

"I'm pretty sure we'll get more of it," she answered as they both gazed into each other's eyes.

For one moment if felt like the world had stopped around Jason. He couldn't believe it to be true. The girl he had started to like apparently seemed to have the same feelings for him as well.

"You know you can come by to Pinereach anytime. I can show you around," he said.

"We've seen it already didn't we."

"No that's just the Valdrek estate. You haven't seen the city itself and the surrounding areas," Jason replied.

"Okay then we'll see what more does your home has to offer."

Jason smiled as he looked down for a moment. 

Senara then asked, "I've seen you four always messing with each other when you're together. Seems like all that royalty and lineage doesn't seem a boundary to you."

Jason answered, "Well we grew up together here in the Palace. Our Father was a close commander of the King. Before he became the Lord of Pinereach. All of our childhood was spent here. That's why think of each other the same from beginning. I don't think it's gonna change even if he becomes the King."

Senara answered, "Well that's a rare thing to have. Often when someone becomes heir like your friend. You have to show respect to him."

"I think that's for the royal events, when everyone is there. When it's just us, I don't think it's needed."

Senara smiled and replied, "That's good, but friendships are not always like this. You guys are lucky to have that."

"Maybe that's not the only thing we're lucky to get," he said.

"What else?" she asked.

"Well when you admire someone and the same thing comes back, if that's not lucky then..."

"Only admire?" she raised a brow and asked.

Jason didn't knew what to say. He didn't spoke for a moment.

Senara said, "Well..., if you don't wanna tell then maybe I should go," she straightened and as she turned to walk away.

"No...," Jason said as he grabbed her arm," wait." Her eyes widened as she looked at him. He politely pulled her back toward the pillar she leant with.

"Then what?" she asked.

"I don't know how to say this but when I saw you at dinner at our home and the way you looked at me..., honestly I felt like something has struck me."

"What struck you?" she asked with narrowed eyes and a smile.

"Well the thing that makes your heart gallop like a horse."

Senara looked at him but didn't say anything.

He said, "Well you also said you'll give the answer soon," a bit louder this time.

"Yeah..., but I didn't say when," Senara answered.

"You'll keep me waiting then."

"I guess so," she said with a smile and widened eyes.

Jason shook his head as he took a breath, he nodded. 

"Fine," he whispered, only to be himself able to hear it.

The door creaked open and Arlen stepped out from the room. He saw them both standing by the pillars. "You took long enough," Jason said, his arms crossed as he was leant on the pillar.

"I gave you long enough as well," Arlen replied. He then looked at Senara and gave a polite nod. 

She looked at Jason and their gaze met one last time before she strode toward the room. Arlen and Jason also then walked off, with Arlen's arm around Jason's shoulders. 

Two different stories for the two brother like companions. One gave away his feelings and the other a detail that might allow the Azlari to plant their claws in the Zevaran heart lands. Only time will tell what fate awaits the two.
