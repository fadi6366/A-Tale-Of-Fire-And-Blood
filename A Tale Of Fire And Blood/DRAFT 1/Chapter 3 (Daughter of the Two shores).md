# Chapter 3 (Daughter of the Two shores)

**The same day, Bayside Landing, Shinobi Isles...**


Pale sunlight reflected off the the Crimson Sea. Gulls screeching on the beaches of the Shinobi Isles. The horn of ships blowed in the harbour. Waves swashed against the shore, dampening the sand. The sailors were loading the goods on the ship that was set to sail later that day. Merchants calling out people to come and buy their stuff. The wooden pier creaked under the weight of the people roaming on it. Boats stopping at the shore as fishermen brought their catch of the morning.

The captain asked the sailor if all the goods were loaded, the sailor with the parchment in hand, "Yes Capt'n, all the goods loaded on her, she's all set to sail west,"

"Good, call for the ones who are to sail with us. The envoy gonna sail today as well, ain't he?"

"Yes Capt'n"

"Send word for em to be here by evening."

The sailor nodded, he started to shout for the people to get ready, the ship will leave by evening.

The busy harbour could be seen from the yard of the castle on the steeps of a hill, just half a mile away from the harbour. An arrow swished through the air as it struck the target placed there, just an inch or a half from the centre. She sighed as she nocked another one _come on_ , Elaria who has been practicing archery since he had her morning meal. Two of her fingers covered in the leather of the archery glove, her gaze locked on the target as she brought it near to her jaw.

A young runner stood by the entrance to the yard, he stood there, watching her as she loosed the arrow and it struck the target, a bit closer to the centre this time. As she nocked another one, the runner walked in the yard as he caught his breath, "Lady Elaria," he lifted the parchment in his hand, "This is for you."

Elaria's gaze turned toward the boy, she grabbed the letter from the lad, seal of her father, the Prime Advisor of the Azlari King on it. She broke the seal with her fingers. Gesturing the boy to go, he bowed and walked off. Elaria let out a breath as she unrolled the page, on it's lower-right corner was the sigil of the Ilantian Kingdom of Azralan.

> The King orders you to join the envoy going to Zevaria, you will be our eyes and ears in their palace. You have Zevarian blood in you, they'll welcome you openly. Send word as you get to know any thing that might prove crucial for our cause.
>                                                   - Cassimar Aelvan, Prime Advisor.

Elaria sighed as her eyes ran across the words on the page. She looked toward the harbour, _so it's  time_, she thought. _Mother's native lands, fate finally takes me there_, she'll now travel west, the lands her mother grew up in. 
Now after years had passed, growing up in Ilantia, then spending three years in the Shinobi Isles, training, studying and learning about Zevarian culture, she will now step in her mother's native lands, not as someone who belonged there but as a spy, the eyes and ears of the Azlari King.

Sunlight peaked at the clouds cleared open during the afternoon hours. The wind, still cold blew across the Isles. Gulls screeching as they jumped from ship decks to the pier to the sand shore. 
Elaria stood by the pier as she watched her stuff being taken on the ship. Her mind flashing the years she spent on the Isles, learning about Zevarian culture and her training, it felt like yesterday she came here, and now she'd head west to spy in a land very much foreign to her. _When will I return? Or will I?What will the royal family be like?_, her mind sparking several questions. 

Her friend Senara, also from Ilantia, walked closer from behind. "So..., yee mission begins ey?" faking her accent, in a teasing tone as she stopped by Elaria, slightly pushing her by the shoulder.

"You know..., you suck at copying pirates."

They both share a light giggle, Senara looked at Elaria's face, nervous and troubled for the task ahead, "You look like as you're already halfway across the Crimson Sea," she said.

Elaria with a sigh, "You know, it feels strange, all this..., I don't know how to say it. My mother... she was from there and..., now. I... I'm going there not as someone who belongs, but someone who's just there to collect information," she took a pause, her gaze down at the wooden pier, before she continued, "Born in Ilantia, came here and spent three years, and... now I am being sent to the lands my mother came from."

Senara tilted her a head slightly, smile on her face, "Well... who knows, you might find someone there," she teased. Elaria remained silent, she shook her head slightly, as she smiled.

"Or maybe you miss Kaelen, he sure would have gotten upset about King Orestane sending you west."

Elaria sighed, "That psycho can get upset about it as much... as he wants. I have no interest in him, not at, ALL!!!" she turned toward Senara as she spoke.

"Then it means, our lovely lady Elaria can find someone in the foreign lands she's heading to."

"Alright... that's it, pack you're stuff you're coming as well." Elaria spoke quickly as she grabbed Senara's shoulder and turned her toward the castle, "The ship leaves by evening, get what you need we don't have time."

"But, it's..."

"I want you by my side there, I can't spend months there all by myself." 

Senara nodded as she walked off toward the castle. 

Elaria teasing her from behind, her voice loud, "Be quick..., or the ship will leave without you."

Senara smiled as she turned to give Elaria a look before continuing toward the castle.

Elaria turned toward the sea, looking at the horizon, _So... here we go._

**Back at Zevaragrad...**

Clouds covered the sun as it fought to spray it's light over the Capital. Winter's cool breeze blew across, leaves rustling and some flying off the trees. Merchants and traders arriving and some departing through the main gates. Young recruits rehearsed with their blades in the training arena, as the teacher stood their and watched, Too slow boy..., your stance is weak, you're gripping it too tight..., he gave instructions to the rookies as they danced along. 

The courtyard will filled with murmurs of courtiers and generals, Darius and Nikolai discussing about Arlen being declared hero of the Battle and given thousands of soldiers in his personal command, "You really think he can command them, my Prince?"

"Father expects a lot from him, ever since we've returned from South, he doesn't tire from singing songs about him, and now... the Red River has reputed him even more..."

"He did win every battle in that war my Prince."

Darius's eyes sharpened as he snarled , "He didn't win it himself, he's given all the praise because he's a Prince, Trifon was there with him, that Valdreks' lad was with him, along with other commanders," his face showing disgust, "You really think a boy can plan so perfectly?" Darius squinted his eyes.

Nikolai tilted his head, lifting his brows, "Well..., they themselves credit him for those victories, especially the one at Dharan."

Darius, about to grab Nikolai from the collar, but he halted his hand as they were in a crowd of courtiers, he curled it into a fist, "So you're singing his songs ,now that Father has given you into his command."

"No my Prince, my alligance is to you and always will be."

"Good, you'll be my ears and eyes around him, whatever he does, wherever he goes with those men, comes through me".

Nikolai nodded, "Yes my Prince."

Arlen stood in the balcony, leaning on the pillar, arms crossed, as he watched the courtyard. He could clearly see the faces of those who looked happy after the court and those who didn't. He could see Darius and Nikolai, anticipating Darius up to no good again, looking at his angry face, as Darius glanced back at him a couple of times. Arlen could feel it in his eyes, the envy and fire he had against his younger brother. _What did I even do, that you hate me so much now?_ , he swallowed, eyes filled with despair. _We were brothers..., before you outcasted me like I was some bastard, whom father adopted._ 

Footsteps approached from behind, "I've never seen someone mourn after being declared hero of battle", Julian as usual with his teasing tone toward Arlen, as he walked pass Arlen before leaning on the pillar just opposite.

"You're still mad at me, about dinner, aren't you?"

"What...?" Arlen looked at Julian, " No..., no, I'm not,", then turned his gaze back down to the yard.

"Then why you're standing here like you doubt your own existence," he said, tone sarcastic, tilting his head slightly.

Arlen closed his eyes for a moment as he sighed, "He hates me..., ever since Father declared me his successor after the war, Darius..., he completely changed, I don't even recognize him now." he said.

"Well, he was always whinny about..., what he thought, was his," Julian raised raised a brow, tilting his head.

Arlen smiled, "He's not wrong..., grew up believing he was the one, then Father chose me," he let out a breath. Julian nodded.

For a few moments none of them spoke, looking down at the yard, Julian turned his gaze toward Arlen a couple of times before looking back down. Then breaking the silence, "Some of them do seem upset about Father giving you your personal guard."

"It seems most of them are upset."

"How's it feeling? Like a burden or like a privilege?"

Arlen raised his brows, "I don't know..., if it's a privilege or a burden. Some of them see me as someone they can look up to, most see me as a reckless boy."

Julian looked at Arlen, "That's how the world works, when you get something, half of it cheers for you, the other half becomes your enemy, as they think you're useless, you don't deserve all that you're getting."

Arlen also turned his gaze toward Julian, "And you...? Which side are you on?"

Julian straightened, he stepped closer to Arlen, "I'm on the side of the Kingdom, our dynasty built over centuries," he said before he walked off.

Arlen wasn't impressed by his answer, his sharpened his eyes as he watched him step away across the gallery, his boots echoed, cloak swung in rhythm with his steps as he disappeared at the end of the corridor. Wind blew, strands of Arlen's hair lapped over his face as he turned toward the courtyard now almost emptied as the courtiers and Darius were gone, he also then straightened and walked off toward his chamber.
