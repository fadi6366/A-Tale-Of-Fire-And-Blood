# Chapter 9 (When Two worlds meet - II)

The cold wind carried dried leaves across, scattering some of them in the yard of the manor. It had gone a bit quieter after the guests were taken in to the chambers given to them after the arrival. The gentle breeze brushed his hair on his forehead and cheek as he stood leaning to the pillar, along with his brother and friends.

Arlen had his arms crossed as he looked at the gate of the manor. Fredrick was laughing as he shared joke and banter with Jason and Eran. He looked at the prince who was lost in the thoughts of the lady he just locked gaze with, he blushed as he recalled that sight in his mind.

"Awww..., look the little Prince finally looses his heart...," he paused, Fredrick walked toward toward Arlen, he placed his hand on his shoulder, gripping it teasingly tight, Arlen felt it and tightened his teeth with his tongue between them, squinting one of his eyes, Fredrick brought his lips closer to Arlen's ear, "And that too..., to a foreign lady."

"What...? No..., it isn't...,like that," Arlen stuttered the words, a smile still on his face that clearly denied what he said.

Jason, stood by the wall just across the width of the gallery, Eran leaning on it just beside him, Jason spoke, his voice, a hint louder, "Don't say you didn't," he stepped toward Arlen who now had turned around after hearing his voice, he continued, "We saw the way you looked at her and froze like ice," he paused, a grin appeared on his face, eyes lit up, "And your gaze following her as she climbed the steps to the yard."

Arlen's lips tightened, though his face did reflect a smile, which could be seen through his eyes, Fredrick laughed, he clapped his hand on Arlen's back, a little harder this time, he said, "Don't worry..., accept it, we won't tell anyone..., if you don't..., I'll go and talk to the lady myself that she has caught our Prince's sight."

Arlen grabbed Fredrick's arm, his brows furrowed but that glow still on his face, "Are you crazy...? No, we don't...," he paused, his chest rose as he sucked up air and then let it go, "Fine..., yes I like her...," he looked at Jason, his voice now a little hard, "But..., not that much."

Eran stepped closer, a brotherly tease in his voice, "You've admitted it now, little or much..., still counts."

Jason's smile widened revealing his teeth, he looked as Arlen and raised his brow, gesturing toward Eran, "He's right and...," he leaned toward Arlen, "I think you should go talk to her."

Arlen, now softly pushed Fredrick back, he looked at Jason as he said, "I think I'll go and sit with my sister, we've met after months," he walked inside, looked at Eran and smiled as he strode off.

Fredrick laughed, he placed his elbow in Jason's shoulder, "Yes..., he's in love."

Jason's tongue brushed over his lips, "He sure is...," he turned toward Fredrick, "You know better don't you," face glowing.

Fredrick nodded, himself blushing from the thought of the girl he himself loved. Jason gestured at Eran to come, "You said you love to loosen arrows, come let's have a look who's better."

A rush of happiness ran across Eran's body, he was up to challenge Jason gave him, he answered with the same eagerness, "Looks like you're too eager to loose."

Jason raised his brows, widening his mouth with a smile revealing his teeth, he was surprised by Eran's courage, "Alright then, bring your bow let's have a duel."

Fredrick called in a servant who set up the target for them in the yard and the two of them started to take turns, arrows hissed through the air before they struck the target, both of them shot with some accuracy. Even though, being more experienced, he won the duel, Eran's abilities at this young age did impress Jason who was the same age of Arlen. Jason teased Eran but not much, avoiding damaging his morale. Eran though a bit disappointed, but he knew it was a friendly duel and Jason was older and experienced, he didn't behave in such to ruin the warmth of the moment between the brothers beyond blood.

The room was lit up by the candle that sat on the table on the side of the bed, and the pale light that came in from the glass window. It was warmer inside, contrary to the cold of winter outside. Maria sat on the bed, she had just took off the warm cloak she wore on the road here. The blanket covered her lap, her bare feet rested on the rug beside the bed after she took off the boots. She drank water from the cup and placed it on the table. About to lie down, she heard a knock on the door.

Maria sighed, her voice polite, reflecting her tiredness she said, "Come in..."

The hinges creaked as the door slowly swung away from the timber, a hand politely pushing it open. It was Arlen, who came to share a moment with his sister whom he met after three summers.

He smiled, his voice low and brotherly, "I hope I didn't disturb you."

Maria straightened up when she saw her brother, her lips widened for a smile, "When was the last time you didn't...," she said as her brows slightly, her cheeks forming a small dimple.

Arlen's smile widened as he stepped in, closing the door slowly behind him. Maria gestured him to come and sit, she pulled the blanket on the side to give him space, but not off herself. He removed his boots before he stepped on the rug, and then sat on the bed.

She rubbed her fingers through his hair, both shared a smile, she looked at his eyes as she said, "You've grown up, since the last time I saw you."

Arlen with the smile present on his face, eyes lit up by it, "Well..., the last time you visited home, I was riding south with Father and Darius."

Maria placed her palm beside his cheek, "I was worried..., when mother told me you rode to the war, you we're so young."

Arlen placed his hand over Maria's, "Young men have done wonders..., before us..., I wanted to do the same."

"You did..., I've heard about your victories there," she said with a motherly pride in her voice," Even that girl spoke of the stories she heard about you on the road here."

Arlen's eyes narrowed, yet his face still carried that blush, _Wait what?_ , he shook his head slightly.

"She heard some story about the war at the Centaki Island, where they anchored while sailing here," Maria answered, though she saw that bit of confusion and excitement on his face.

His lips curled as his brow raised, he turned his eyes in front of him and nodded, "Oh...," _What did she tell Maria, what did they talk about me?_ , he said politely, "It was indeed a hell of a clash, didn't thought my plan will work though."

Maria judged his excitement hidden behind the calm, she controlled her giggle but her eyes and cheeks did gave a hint of a smile, she said in a polite teasing tone, "She was impressed I can tell, she didn't say it but when she talked about what she heard about you, it showed her admiration."

_Holyyyyy.....shhh....._ Arlen let himself not get out of control with excitement, he felt as if the girl he saw might feel the same, maybe they might get along well, he tried not to show it on his face but his sister old enough to know, saw it clearly. He tried to keep it together, "Well..., that's..., good I..., guess."

"You like her don't you?" Maria asked, raising her brow, lowered his head slightly toward him.

 Arlen's blush faded into a nervous smile, he answered with a hush or air coming out his mouth, "No..., I don't, what makes you think like that?"

Maria leant back, resting on the bed's headboard, "It's written all over your face, you can lie to everyone, even your self," she then leant toward him, this time whispering in his ear, "But I know you well enough, little brother, and...," she then straightened, her voice now louder this time, " She has Zevarian blood."

Arlen brows furrowed, he asked, "What? How? Who is she anyways?"

Maria replied, "Oh..., I almost forgot, she's Cassimar's daughter, she's come here with the envoy..., you didn't hear that when you got word of our arrival?"

"I was told about the envoy and you..., they talked about a couple of girls along as well, I didn't knew, I thought they'd be your servants or maybe his daughters."

"No..., she's the daughter of the Prime Advisor of the Azlari King."

"Then how does she have Zevarian blood?"

"Her mother was from our lands, she was at the Shinobi Isles when the Azlari invaded, she was among the slaves they took back with them."

Arlen curled his lips as he raised his head, looking at the wall, _Ooh that explains it_ . He answered as he looked back at Maria, "So..., who was she? Her mother."

Maria shook her head, she squinted her lips, she replied, "We don't know, she told me her mother died when she was young."

His brows raised after hearing the news, he let out a sigh, "May God Bless her soul."

Maria nodded. Both of them didn't spoke for a moment. Then she grabbed his arm politely with a smile on her face, "Now..., you be careful before making any move, even though her mother belonged to our lands, she still grew up in the Azlari court."

Arlen nodded, he sighed as he looked at Maria, it seemed words were to come out of his mouth but didn't.

Maria looked at him, she knew he wanted to say something. She said in a polite voice, "Go on..., say it, I know you have something to spit out."

Arlen bit his lip for a moment as he took a breath. He turned toward her and said, "Do you think she'll..., I don't know..., do you think it'll work?"

Maria leaned ahead and wrapped her arm around Arlen's shoulder she said, "Look..., I can't say for sure..., but..., as far as I know her after travelling with her to here, she has a good heart," she pulled her arm back, "But you must still be aware, we don't know why Cassimar would allow his own daughter to travel to a foreign land."

Arlen swallowed, _Guess I'll have to be conscious then._ His face now relaxed, showing no emotion or blush, he replied in a lower voice, "I understand," as he nodded.

Both of them then talked for a bit longer before Arlen stood up, saying she should rest now after a long journey and that they have long way ahead as well before reaching home. He then walked out, closing the door politely behind him. He kept thinking about what his sister told him about the lady he was about to pour his heart to. _What if I'm wrong? Should I act like this?_ He kept wondering as he walked across the gallery. 

At the other side of the gallery someone stood watching him from behind, it was Elaria who was coming that way. She saw him leave the room, her eyes blinked softly as she stared at the Prince. She did notice how he looked at her at the arrival, _What's happened to him?_ She saw his confused face from the distance when he came out of the room. 

***

Later, when the dusk bid it's farewell for the day. In their room, lit up by a lamp and some candles, Elaria and Senara sat on the bed, talking about the travel to Pinereach, they had told the servant to bring the food to the room. During the wait for him to arrive, they heard a knock on the door. Senara asked who was it?. The door opened and Maria leant in, "You two should join us in the dinner, come on..., they're waiting."

Both of them looked at each other, then nodded and gestured to Maria that they're coming. 

"I've asked Uncle William for you both to join us on the table, he agreed," Maria smiled as she told them about asking Fredrick's father. Elaria expressed her gratitude to her as the three of them walked toward the dinner room.

The dinner room at the estate was lit by candles and the fireside. The table was setup by the servants. Everyone now started to gather at the table. William and Olivia sat at one edge, Fredrick and Jason on Olivia's right. Arlen and Eran came a bit later and took their seats beside Fredrick and Jason. He noticed two extra chairs placed beside where Maria was supposed to be seated.

A few moments later, they walked in. Arlen's eyes caught at Elaria as she entered, his heart raced, as he saw her walk in. For a moment his legs felt numb, time seemed to have paused during the moments she stepped in and walked toward the table. Her gaze turned to Arlen as she approached her seat, he took his gaze away, to not look strange again. Elaria had noticed him now staring at her, her lips slightly curved from the corner but not a full smile. She took her seat right after Senara sat beside Maria. Now both of them sat opposite to each other, right in front.

Arlen wasn't the only one who was intrigued by the guest. Jason who sat along side him also became a prey to the sickness of the heart. He also had locked gaze with Senara for a moment when she entered the hall, but this one was different from Arlen and Elaria's case. Both of them felt something inside, though hesitant to give any hints or expression, they also sat opposite and in front of each other.

The servants then poured in the nectar in the cups and placed plates with deer meat and bowls filled with some stew in front of everyone. The room was lit up with murmurs between the family, and the clash of spoon with the plates as they savoured the meal.

William after finishing the stew looked at Maria, "Your Highness" he bowed his head slightly as addressed her politely, she looked up toward him. He said, "How was the road from Dragonsweil, I hope no trouble came to you while riding here."

Maria put her hand in front of her mouth and after swallowing, answered in her polite tone , "No uncle...," she paused, "It was a safe road, who would dare touch the daughter of King Theron?" her tone reflecting her pride.

Arlen smiled, his gaze down on his meal as he ate it. Senara raised her brows, her lips quenched but she also didn't look up.

William nodded, he took a sip of the nectar, "And how was the room, was it prepared well by our servants?" he further asked.

"They did a fine job uncle. I'm truly grateful for everything," Maria answered in a respected tone, a warm smile on her face.

Arlen looked at Elaria for a moment as he smiled, she also looked at him and they shared a glance for a moment, briefly but enough to race Arlen's heart.

William then discussed about the King and Queen with Maria that they would be waiting for her to arrive, Maria approved and a brief warm talk between them continued. Even though William was just a Lord but the Zevarans had massive respect for the Valdreks, that reflected from Maria's way of talking with Fredrick's father.

William then turned his gaze toward Elaria and asked about the travel from Bayside Landing to Dragonsweil and then to Pinereach.

"Yes..., it was..., tiring..., but we've arrived safely," Elaria answered, her voice soft and a calm tone.

Arlen's hand was curled into a fist that covered his mouth He let a breath out before his eyes caught at Elaria while she spoke, though his head slightly turned down, but his gaze at front. He tightened his fingers as his gaze caught at Elaria. Each time he looked at her, he felt his heartbeat react to it, a warmth inside his chest hard to ignore. _Man she's gorgeous_. 

William gestured of approval with his head, he further asked, "And what does Lord Azekial say about these lands. Since he's the envoy sent by the King himself. I'd like to know his thoughts about Zevaria."

Elaria was about to speak but Senara interrupted, in her casual tone but she tried to stay formal, "He's always wondering about his duty, doesn't bother show any reaction to what goes around."

Jason looked at her with a slight smile as she spoke to William. Senara looked back at him, _He's cute_ she rolled her lips as she smiled turning her gaze down. Butterflies rose in his stomach watching her smile like that. _Son of a fish... she smiled at me._ 

Maria was noticing both of Arlen and Jason as they stared at the guests by the moment, she smiled slightly and locked gaze with Arlen once. Arlen knew her sister is noticing him watching the guest.

Fredrick slightly leaned toward Jason, whispering low so only his brother could hear, "I guess Arlen's not the only one who's fallen for a foreign girl."

Jason controlled his laugh, he almost spat the food. Senara saw it and a blush ran over her face, noticed by Elaria. Eran also had a controlled laugh.

She leaned toward Senara, whispering slowly, "I think you've found someone in these foreign lands." Senara tightened her lips, couldn't help but smile. _Someone who seems good for once_.

William and Olivia watched the young have their moment, figured they better not interfere at least for now. Everyone then had their meal before leaving their seats and moving out from the room to their chambers.

***

The sky was clear that night, also completely dark because it was night of no moon. Only thing that shined were the stars that spread across the skies. Winter now slowly lost it's peak as the month of Glacivar approached it's later half. 

Inside the room Arlen rested, it was warm in contrast to the chill outside. The only light was the faint glow of the candle that flickered after brief gaps. Arlen slept, his body covered by the cozy blanket, his face upright. His brows furrowed as he moved his head, changing his side, giving off slight groans. The candle flickered almost in harmony to what was happening in his Dream. 

He sucked in air hard as he opened his eyes and sat up. His felt a burn in his chest, similar to the one, he had before. His put his hand on it, he looked around, eyes wide. _What in the world was that? I never seen anything like if before._ His dream was different this time, though he did see those ghosts from his past but something more followed, something he was unfamiliar with. 

The candle had stopped flickering after he woke up. His heart raced, he looked upwards at he took deep breaths, slowly. His gaze then caught itself at the window, completely dark outside, a slight hiss of wind was heard as it blew, but then halted.  

Arlen pushed the blanket away with his legs, he held his forehead, eyes closed. _What's happening to me?_ He rubbed his fingers down against his face and sighed. _I need some fresh air_. He jumped out of his bed, rubbed his eyes and drank some water from the cup. He swung his cloak on and pushed his toes into his shoes. The door slowly creaked as he pulled it open. 

The cold wind sent chills across his face as he walked through the gallery toward the balcony. His mind replayed that dream again and again, including his regrets of the past. His shoes echoed against the gallery floor in silence as he walked ahead. The door was already open when he reached there. His eyes glared, _Who opened it? At this time of night?_ He stepped ahead and saw someone standing in the dark night by the railing. Head covered by the cloak.

Arlen stepped toward the person, hearing the footsteps approach they turned behind. Arlen's brows relaxed but he eyes widened, it was Elaria. She also saw a dream somewhat similar to Arlen, and came out for air. Her eyes also restless, she looked at him with curiosity, _What's he doing here? Did he follow me?_ 

Arlen's heart raced as he saw her, _What's she doing here? Why didn't she sleep?_ his fist now relaxed, curled fingers opened. Both of their gaze met for a couple moments, Elaria then turned ahead, toward the rail. Arlen let out a breath, mist flew out of his mouth. _Now what do I say to her? This is not how I thought of our first time meeting. Oh well..._. 

He stepped forward and leant on the railing, his gaze down toward the torches on the both sides of the gate. He curled the fingers of his both into one another, elbows rested on the railing. He lowered his head and let out a breath, eyes closed.

Elaria looked at him as he tried to gather himself, the corner of her lips curved for a moment, then straightened as she looked ahead at the dark horizon and the stars that spread across. For a brief moment there was silence between them. Elaria looked at him again, his head still down, she swallowed and then broke the silence, "Couldn't sleep?" her voice low and soft.

Arlen raised his head, his brows also lifted, he stretched his arms and then straightened, Elaria's gaze followed as he stood straight. He took a deep breath and then answered, "No..., I just..., thought I needed some air," his gaze ahead at the horizon as he stuttered.

Elaria kept her gaze at him and smiled as he answered, she then turned her stare ahead, neither of them spoke. An awkward silence between the two, a young lad who coincidently met the girl he just found his heart for earlier that day, and the girl who met the Prince she heard about on her way there. She had noticed him look at her during the dinner, and she had that in her mind.

Elaria raised her head, then turned her eyes toward Arlen. Her lips quenched before she swallowed, "It's cold isn't it," she said with a smile, mist coming out her mouth as she spoke.

Arlen looked at her, "Yes..., you know..., winter..., but it's going now..., these few days and then the next month," words stumbled as they poured out of his mouth, he turned his gaze ahead.

Elaria kept her gaze at him, the stutter of words and his hesitation did felt intriguing to her, the Prince who's valor she'd heard about during her voyage, now a shy lad trying to open up. She asked, "And then?" her voice soft and deeper this time.

Arlen bit his lip for a moment before brushing his tongue over it, his looked at her as he answered, "And then..., there's spring..., bloomrise comes and..., a festival, to celebrate the arrival of spring, you should see it, it's fascinating to be there," he felt a bit of comfort this time speaking.

Elaria's smile widened, her eyes narrowed, she asked, "So..., what's in the festival?"

"Two weeks of the city fully dressed like a bride, horse dances, warriors fight to see who's the strongest, archers have duels...," he gestured with his hand, "There's a food fest and..., a lot of things."

"You really seem to love this festival."

"Yes.., a lot...," he paused, and turned his gaze ahead, _I haven't been there for the last three years because of war_ He swallowed and took a moment. Curving his lips to a smile before he continued, "You'll love it as well, once you see it," he looked at her.

Elaria crossed her arms as turned her back toward the railing, leant by it, she answered, "Well..., if the Prince himself says so, I might as well go and see it..." her head tilted with gaze at him.

Arlen crossed his arms. He asked with a smile, "I assume you people also have something similar back there."

"We do..., every time a new year comes, that night is celebrated by our people as a new beginning."

They both looked into each others eyes as she spoke. Arlen almost lost in hers. The pale gold and grey from the lamp in the gallery fell on her face, adding to the appeal, his heart now raced. For a moment the words she spoke seemed to fade. She saw him doze out, and snapped her fingers in front of his face. "What happened?" she asked, with a giggle.

Arlen blinked his eyes, as he shook his head slightly, he asked, "What?"

Elaria's cheeks dimpled, her lips showing her teeth, she said, "Nothing..., I think you really didn't sleep well."

His heart raced, _Damn you Arlen, you've embarrased yourself_. He smirked, " Well, I guess..., but it's a long night, I'll catch up on it," he said, in a quick rhythm. 

A small blow of cold came across, Elaria tightened her arms, she shivered slightly, "It's getting cold, isn't it," she said, letting mist out.

Arlen answered, "Well Thank God it isn't one of those snowy nights, it gets freezing here out at night."

Elaria smirked, "I heard you people like cold and frozen nights."

Arlen answered, "Now which halfwit told you that, I mean I do like it but not the freezing cold," he looked toward the stars at the horizon, "I prefer something in between, like the spring nights."

Elaria added, her voice now low and soft, "That's why you enjoy celebrating the spring."

Arlen nodded, he rested his arms on the railing. He curled his hands into each other,  his lips curved, "Yes..., perfect nights, in fact...," he looked at her, "Even in summer, they're cooler, only the day sweats the hell out of you sometimes." 

Elaria looked at the dark sky, only the sparkling stars lit it up, but the moon's absence felt still. She turned around facing the same way Arlen did, resting his arms on the rail and curling her hands. She said, "I wish the moon was out tonight, you don't get a clear sky during winter."

Arlen looked up, "Yes..., mostly it's cloudy, even rain and blizzards, and..., you're right. Without the moon, it does feel empty."

"You like it?"

"Like what?"

"The moon, when it shows it's full face, you like coming out and staring at it."

"I do..., feels peaceful, silence around, everyone is asleep and you're out there sitting, staring at it as it looks back at you."

Elaria looked at him, they both met gaze, _I guess we both have something in common..._

Arlen felt a warmth inside, his beat raced a bit as he gazed in her eyes for that moment, _I wish time stops here._ 

Elaria brought her hand in front her mouth, as it widened for a yawn, she said, "Maybe we should go to sleep, it's been too late."

Arlen nodded, he answered, "Yes..., we have a long road ahead tomorrow, we should rest now."

Both straightened, Arlen gestured her to go first toward the gallery, both met their for one last time for the night. Elaria in a soft, low voice said, "Have a good night..., your Highness," she nodded. Arlen nodded back, "Good Night."

Elaria then walked inside, Arlen staring at her as she her shoes echoed on the floor, even though it seemed accidental but still enough for a rush of happiness run through him. He turned around for a moment to look at the horizon before he also walked in toward his room.
