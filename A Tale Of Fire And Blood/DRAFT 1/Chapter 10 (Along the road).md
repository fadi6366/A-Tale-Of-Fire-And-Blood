# Chapter 10 (Along the road)


**Next day 18th Glacivar 1701 AC**

Sun shined over Pinereach, though the wind still cold. Usually it would be cloudy at these days of the year, but sometimes sun also would come out to give its regards. The nightingale sung as people welcomed the new day.

At the manor William and Olivia stood with their sons. Bidding them farewell for the road as Arlen told them to ride along to Zevaragrad. Olivia kissed Fred on his forehead, "May God take you safely there," he gave a smile as his mother gave her blessings. After Fred stepped back Jason followed and took the blessings of his mother.

Olivia looked at her sons with a heavy heart. _Why do they follow that reckless boy everywhere?_ Even though the Valdreks had a sworn loyalty to the Zevarans. Her husband admired the Prince by heart, her sons considered him their own brother, she didn't like that. She didn't appreciate Fred and Jason being too close to Arlen, more then a usual for mality.

They bowed as Arlen and Eran walked out, wearing their armour and cloaks, their shoes echoed against the concrete floor. They shook hands with their friends and their father, and gave a respectful nod to the Lady of the house. Olivia responded with a fake smile on her face. William noticed it and tried not to react. Maria strode out just after, she gave her respects to the Lord and his wife. 

She stood by Arlen after meeting them. Arlen leaned slightly toward her. With a curve on his lips' corner, he whispered, "Took you long enough."

Maria whispered back, "Says the Prince who used to wake up after everyone had their morning meal," holding back her smile.

Arlen's cheeks dimpled, as they both straightened.

Fred saw his mother's face and felt the tension, he knew she didn't admire the Prince. They had multiple talks about this before, especially when they rode for war three summers ago. Just a few moments later the guests also walked out. The envoy in his formal attitude, strode out. His grey cloak brushed against the floor as he climbed down the steps into the yard. Followed by Elaria and Senara. 

Arlen and Jason looked at them as they walked out the door, Senara looked back at Jason. Her face reflected a shy smile as she rolled her lips inwards. They didn't met in private yet, but something inside them did flare up after seeing each other at the dinner the day prior. Elaria met Arlen's eyes as she stood just opposite to him, their gaze did last a bit longer. Last night's moment still recalling in their minds as they shared brief smiles before breaking gaze.

Arlen stepped forward toward William, he nodded and said, "It's been a wonderful three nights here, Uncle. I'm very grateful for the hospitality, you've shown... I would be glad to welcome you someday at the Capital," in a tone pouring respect for the Lord.

William bowed before he replied, "It was an honour for me, Your highness. I hope fate allows us to visit some day," reflecting his respect for the Prince. Olivia had her gaze down, slightly rolling her eyes.

Arlen looked at Fred and gave a subtle shake of his head, gesturing they should mount now. He took a couple steps back as he said, "Alright then..., the road awaits us."

_Finally...,_ the envoy sighed. He walked out the gate. His guard gestured him toward the carriage, without looking back he climbed in. The rider splashed the rein and the horse strode just to move the carriage ahead, to allow the second one at that spot.

Arlen gestured the ladies with his hand, to the carriage. Elaria glanced at his eyes, and stepped toward their ride, followed by Senara. He turned back toward his sister, smiling he tilted his head. Maria smirked as she walked toward him and said, "Good luck tiger, you seem to have caught her eye well," he smirked as he looked in her eyes. She then stepped through the gate and climbed in the carriage.

Eran then walked toward Arlen. Arlen rubbed his fingers across Eran's hair, "Let's, head home then." Fred and Jason followed just behind. Jason placed his arm at Arlen's shoulder, he said, "Yeah, let's head home and welcome the new lady."

 Arlen furrowed his brow as his mouth opened for wider smirk, he looked at Jason, "Well...,well..., look who's talking. I've seen you and her friend share gazes as well," Arlen said as he quickly took Jason by the neck, tightening his elbow around it. He slightly choked him.

Fredrick laughed as he leaned and brought his mouth near Jason's ear, "I told you to not mess with him, now look," he said with a laugh.

Eran lightly biting his tongue, pinched Jason in his hip.

Jason jerked at the pinch and patted Arlen's back, struggling to allow his voice out, "Fine..., Fine..., Now let me go."

Arlen let him go. Jason put his hand on his neck as he stretched. The corner of his lip quenched, eye closed. "Son of a...," he politely tapped Fred's chest, "At least help a brother out," he said as they strode toward the gate laughing. 

William stood beside his wife as watched the young have their moments. He remembered his own days when himself was a young, reckless boy. A smile appeared on his mouth. Olivia on the other hand watched in dislike and during Arlen's lock on Jason's neck, left the yard. Fred saw her leave but he didn't want to ruin the moment his brother and friend was having, so he didn't react.

The group then mounted their horses, riding ahead of the carriages. They strode across the street of Pinereach and out the main gates of the city. The guards nodded to the Prince with respect, he responded back. Then they rode off toward the Red Road that'll take them to Zevaragrad.


***

 The walls of Pinereach slowly behind them as they strode on the pass that led to the Red road. The turn was just few more than a couple hundred yards ahead.

Gesturing with his hand "There she is..., the Red Road," Arlen said in a loud voice and a grin on his face.

"For all my years running on it, I've always wondered why they call it the Red road," Fredrick asked, looking ahead, his hand on the rein.

"I've read in some old scroll, some traders used to travel on it," A small laugh came out as Arlen continued, "They used to get looted almost twice in two or three months on this road, they believed either it's them or this road has a curse. So one wise guy started calling it the Red Road."

Fredrick smirked, "Now where have you read that? And since when did you started reading scrolls?" he asked, looking at Arlen, his brow raised.

"Where did you think I got those stupidly insane ways of fighting against large hosts?" he said, in a proud tone.

Jason who rode just behind them, he raised his head slightly, he said, "Yes yes we know you're a brilliant commander, don't need to rub it in our faces every time you speak," in a teasing voice.

Arlen inhaled, he didn't look at him, just turned his head slightly behind, "Loud mouth," he said loudly.

"Stagface."

Arlen opened his mouth to answer, but another voice cut in.

"Chicken legs," said Eran, looking at Jason.

Fred almost laughed, he put his hand in front of his mouth.

"EYYY...," Jason said, his brows furrowed and mouth round, as he looked at Eran. He then turned his eyes toward Fred who rode in front of Eran. "You told him that didn't you?"

Fredrick laughed, "Yes..., I told him to call you that, if you tease him," he said, his gaze ahead.

Arlen turned behind toward Jason, "Look, your own brother gave you away," he said with a grin.

Jason looked at Arlen, "You three have now teamed up, against one poor guy," he said sarcastically.

"You always whine when it's your turn," Eran said.

"Oh look, so the little bird knows how to speak from himself," Jason answered looking at Eran with a brow raised.

Arlen took out an apple from the leather sack tied with the saddle, he bit off it and started chewing as he enjoyed the moment.

"The little bird can shoot as well," Eran answered, tilting his head slightly.

"Oh really..., as far as I remember I won that duel, didn't I?"

"And now you're arguing with a child," Fredrick said as he turned toward Jason.

"He's not a child."

"His still years younger than you," Fred added, glancing at Jason.

Jason looked at Fred, he didn't speak, he turned his eyes ahead. _Well he's right though_ he let out a sigh.

Arlen turned behind him once again, "It's fine..., don't be sad...," he teased him, like he was talking to a child, " here," he took out another apple and tossed it toward Jason. 

Jason caught it right before it hit his face, he looked at it for a moment then started to eat. "Thanks," he said, lowering his brows after he swallowed the bite.

"What about us?" Eran asked loudly, after Arlen gave Jason the apple.

Arlen tossed one toward him as well, "Fine..., here you go."

Eran caught it and started to eat.

"You want one?" Arlen asked Fredrick, still leaning toward the bag. Fredrick nodded and gestured with his fingers to toss one to him. Arlen acceded.

They enjoyed the sweet fruit after a warm chatter among themselves.

"Look we're on the Red road now," Arlen said after he finished his apple. They then took the turn onto the road and walked toward the Capital now. Few more days on the road for the guests that had sailed and rode there.

***

**After Seven days on the road, 25th Glacivar, 1701 AC**

The sky grew darker and orange on the horizon as the sun bid it's farewell for the day. Fallen dried leaves creaked as the horses presses their hooves on them and wheels of the carriages rolled over. The evening was a bit warmer because it hadn't been cloudy for over a week, but during dusk the wind did cooled down. The white that had covered for months now started to vanish as winter prepared to depart.

Arlen saw an inn just few yards off the road. Smoke rose out it's chimney, gold glowed pale from the curtains that hung in the glass windows, thin wooden bars covered them. A small road beside it leading to a nearby town. He signalled with his fist to halt. Everyone pulled the reins of their mounts, bringing them to rest. "We'll spend the night here," he said loudly, looking behind. "Might find a good bed at least," he said, his voice low this time looking at Fred.

He nodded with a smile, "Yes..., I've grown tired of lying down by tree trunks at night," he added.

Jason stretched his arms, "Yes...," he said, tightening the features on his face, "I'd love to have a good meal along as well."

"Wasn't it good? On the previous one we stayed three nights ago?", Arlen asked, narrowing his eyes.

Jason shrugged, "It tasted like wet clothes and..., what about the nights between?" he probed.

They swung off their mounts. Arlen held the rein in his hand, he looked at Jason, "We have to reach Zevaragrad," he gave the rein a slight pull, "And besides..., there was no other inn along the way before this."

They pulled their horse toward the inn and tied the reins to the hitching rails. The carriages followed slowly, halting in front of the entrance. The envoy stepped out of his carriage before the next one came and halted near Arlen. He gestured to the guard who then stepped back. Arlen opened the door, a smile on his face. Elaria there in front of the door, she looked at him and for a moment they both met gaze. Arlen lent his hand, she gave hers before she stepped out of the carriage. 

Arlen let go her hand, her warm and soft fingers brushed against his palm as she slowly pulled them away. He felt a warmth in his chest as this happened. He let out a sigh, "I thought we could use some rest and, this one looks more welcoming than the last."

"I hope the food is better," Elaria said as she looked at him.

He squinched his lips, giving a nod.

Senara then stepped out, Jason lending her his hand, both shared a smiling gaze.

"I hope this one's better, the rooms they gave in the last one were a total mess," she said as she stepped out.

"Well it looks pleasing, that one looked an abandoned stable from afar," Jason looked at her as he answered, his brows furrowed but smiling.

Maria stepped out, she coughed politely, looking at them. They stepped a bit further, making way for the princess. 

Eran stood by Fredrick, he moved toward him a bit, Fred leant to hear what he says.

"These two have found the worst time to fall in love," Eran whispered.

Fredrick held back his giggle, he answered, "That's the best part of it..., and, if you ask me I feel happy for both of 'em."

"No..., I'm talking about the girls, they've found two idiots to fall in love with," Eran said, but he didn't whisper this time.

"I heard that," Arlen said, looking at both of them. Senara covered her mouth to hide her smile. "What are you two yammering about in the corner?"

"We're watching you two, what else could we be doing?" Eran said loudly, arms crossed. Elaria smiled faintly as she looked at Arlen. 

A light breeze came through brushing Arlen's hair across his forehead. He took a glance at Elaria; she had lowered her head a bit, tugging her cloak tighter. "Alright come on now..., let's go inside. It's getting colder," he took a few steps back, gesturing with his hand. "Besides, who knows it might start snowing soon. The sun's had it's days to warm us up."

Eran looked at Fred with a cunning smile, Fredrick patted him on the back then pushed him ahead slightly. They both then walked toward the entrance. Arlen then gestured the rest of them to enter, then following them inside.

***

Torches were lit as the sky darkened into the night. The wooden palisade surrounded the camp, which was in a clearing at the centre of dense forested area. With only one road leading to it, the stronghold was hidden from the local, though spotted by Miron's scouts few weeks ago. At the centre was the wooden cottage, bigger than others, which the commander of the smoke riders, Ivar stayed in. Surrounded by some smaller ones and tents. The inventory just less than a hundred yards away from it.

The gate opened for a group of riders to enter. Their horses slowly marched in, dragging in a couple of carts as well, full of loot and goods they took from the town nearby they recently plundered. Their faces covered by black, their eyes seemed full of thirst as if the blood they spilt till that day wasn't enough. One of the raider's eyes caught at the white banner that flapped in the wind, he looked at the black fenrir etched on it. _This banner will lead us and the Vargoth into these lands one day._ His eyes narrowed slightly to depict a faint smile, he then strode on, riding his horse.

Ivar walked out of his lodge. A young man, fair skinned and dark hair. A grin on his face as he stared his men unload the carts and taking the loot into the warehouse. The one put in-charge of the raid walked toward Ivar. "How much this time?" Ivar asked, his face calm, gaze cold, voice low and content.

"The village was small, commander, didn't offer much grain," the man said. He turned around toward the carts, "But they had some gold we took after we cut them all."

"We need more..., I got word from Hakon, a thousand more men have infiltrated the Zevaran borders from different places," Ivar said as he rubbed his thumb in the palm of his other hand. "We'll need more supplies if we want to keep them fed and ready."

"But commander..., we are running out of room, we already have three thousand here," the man replied.

"Don't worry..., we have the entire Serpent's nest in our hold. And we'll have plenty more once we take Graywatch from them," Ivar tied his arms behind his back as he answered calmly.

"What does Lord Ragnar say? When will he lead his men here?"

"There is still time... Even if we have managed to deceive our way through. The borders are guarded well by the Varangians..."

The man nodded, "When will we take Greywatch?" he asked.

"Not yet..., we still need more men to attack..., the thousand I told you about will arrive here in three weeks..., maybe more."

"We've never moved a thousand men together through the border at once? How have they come through?"

Ivar placed his hand on the man's shoulder, "Even the strongest walls have holes in them, they crept through those holes," he said with a cunning grin on his face, his fingers tightened on the man's shoulder before he continued, "Soon..., we'll take these lands back from these savages who took them from our ancestors."

The man bowed his head, he then stepped back and strode toward the inventory. Ivar stood in his place, running a gaze around the camp. The horizon now lost it's gold as the night approached.

***

The lamps painted gold around the walls and the furnishings of the inn. The hall now almost emptied as travellers set off the road after the dinner or went to the chambers they took for the night. Sound of murmur and chatter from a few tables still echo in the hall. Arlen sat along his brother and friends on one of those, his gaze caught Elaria during the talk with them. She leant beside the window, gazing through it at the dark outside. 

Jason who sat opposite to him on the round table. He chugged in an entire urn of the bevarage before he look at Arlen, who stared at Elaria. He grinned as Arlen's eyes turned toward him. Jason put the urn on the table and tilted his head raising his brow. Arlen smiled and nodded, understanding the gesture of friend telling him to go and talk to the girl.

Arlen pushed his chair back, trying not to make a sound. He then stood up and adjusted his attire. He walked up to her. She didn't notice him approach, kept staring at the window.

Arlen cleared his throat, she heard the cough and looked at the prince standing behind her. "You seem to be lost," Arlen said as he came in front of her and leant by the wall.

"It's nothing..., I just...,"

"You miss your home," Arlen said blinking softly, the lid of eyes showing the smile his lips didn't.

" I think when you've been on the road for months, in lands away from home," Elaria answered, looking at the window. She turned toward Arlen, "It does come to your mind again and again."

"Speaking of lands, what do you think of this side of the world? I'm pretty sure it's different from where you came from."

"It is..., on our way to your friend's house, I've seen valleys and plains, nothing I'd ever seen in my life," she paused, "I mean there are beautiful places at Azlaria as well but.., these lands have caught my eye."

Arlen smiled as he watched her express her amusement of seeing Zevarian lands, he looked at her eyes as she spoke. " What if I say you haven't seen the full beauty of our country yet."

"What do you mean?" she asked, smiling.

"Well..., if I speak honestly..., I haven't visited there myself, but..., when we were south during the war. Somewhere in the Riverlands, they keep calling it the most beautiful place in the south west."

"You didn't see it? While you were down south. If were you I would have rode my horse there right away after hearing that," Elaria answered.

Arlen scratched the back of his neck, "Well we could have but..., it was a bit far from where we had marched," he said.

Elaria tilted her head, the corner of lip curved, "Would you want to go there?"

"I would love to..., if fate wills it."

Elaria nodded, her lips wide with a smile.

Jason stared at them sitting at the table, he shared glances with Fred and Eran grinning along with them. He took sips from the urn as he watched. Fred saw Senara walk toward him, curled his fingers in front of him mouth and coughed. Jason looked at him and Fred gestured with his eyes to look behind. Jason turned and saw Senara walk toward him. Fred gestured toward Eran and they both left the table.

"You seemed to have loved that drink too much I think," Senara smiled as she said, gesturing at the urn in his hand.

Jason put the urn aside on the table and stood up. "I was just..., enjoying with my brothers."

Senara looked at Arlen, she said, "Your friend seems to be busy," Senara stepped closer as Jason glanced at them. "They look good together don't they."

"They sure do..., he seems to have forgotten himself completely since he's seen her," he said before turning toward her, "Do you think she also feels the same for him?"

Senara shrugged, her lips tightened before she answered, "I can't say for sure..., but does she seem intrigued by him."

"She does look like it," Jason added. He looked at them as they both shared a smile. "You're her friend, you should know how she feels."

"Yes..., but she doesn't show it often."

Jason titled his head, "And what about you? Do you show it?"

Senara answered, "You will get your answer...," she blinked slowly and met his gaze, "But I think it needs some time."

Jason felt a surge inside, but he didn't let it get out of hand, he just looked at her eyes. His heart raced and for a moment his breath also felt heavy. _Well..., I'll have to wait then._ 

Arlen's fingers covered his wrist, he looked down with a smile on his face. "Well I hope..., we get a chance soon. To visit those lands." He looked at her eyes, "Maybe..., fate wants me to visit there along with someone."

Elaria asked, narrowing her eyes. "Who could that be?"

"I don't know...," he shrugged. "Maybe someone..., I've already met," Arlen answered in a soft and low voice. 

Elaria didn't answer, she looked down at her hands, her thumb rubbing on the back of the other. _Well if fate wills it. Maybe one day..._ 

Fredrick's gaze switched between Arlen and Jason as he stood beside a table, leaning on the rail of the stairs that led toward the rooms on the upper floor. He threw a carpel of the orange from the inn. Eran stood beside him as he peeled one for himself.

"Do you think those two girls feel the same for them?" Eran said asked softly as he tossed one in his mouth.

"By the way they talk to them..., I can say they'll get what they want very soon," Fred looked at Eran as he answered.

"It's weird. What happens when they like a girl." Eran gestured toward Arlen "I mean look at him. I've never seen him talk to anyone like this except for us and our family." He then looked at Jason, "I've never seen that idiot serious even once."

Fred smiled, he put his hand on Eran's back. I know..., I've been there. Having feelings for someone changes you."

Eran looked at him, "You'll meet her after a long time..., how do you feel?"

"I just want the road to end..." he smiled as he looked at Arlen. "Reminds me of when I was younger."

"Since..., how long have you known her?" Eran asked.

"I was a little older than you. Our father used to serve as a commander in the King's royal guard. We used to stay at the Capital. That's when Arlen and I became friends and I met Victoria," Fredrick smiled as he answered.

"Then why did you leave?"

"Grand-Father died..., and we needed a Lord to look after the tribe and the lands given to us. Father asked the King to allow us to go home."

"Oh...," Eran's lips curved. 

Fred nodded, with a faint smile.

Arlen didn't speak for a few moments. He looked outside and saw the pale light of the moon through the frosted glass. The crescent but the glow faint. He took a breath and said, "At least the moon is out tonight."

Elaria looked up and saw it. Her lips curved into a faint smile, "You're right. If the night was a little warmer," she looked at him as he glanced back. "We would've been outside staring at it."

Arlen smiled, he tilted his head, "Yes..., we would've...." He looked in her eyes, and for a moment everything around seemed to have faded.

The time, as if it had halted. Elaria did feel something, after spending a week alongside the Prince on the road there. She had seen the other side of the Prince, who was a valiant warrior a hero to many. She had noticed him, the way he acted around her and looked at her. The Prince reached out to her hand, his fingers brushed with her while they gazed at each other, he felt the warmth of her fingers. He pulled his hand back, curling it into a fist. Their gaze broke, Elaria held the wrist of her hand. 

"I'm sorry..., I didn't mean to..." Arlen stuttered, he gaze at the ground. 

Elaria answered quickly, "Fine..., it's..., it's nothing..., don't worry," her voice low and soft.

Arlen nodded as he stepped back, _Damn it you fool._ "I think I should go," he said and turned around to walk away toward the room. 

Fredrick watched them from across the hall, his fingers curled in front of his lips. His chest shook as he held back his laugh. _You idiot, what were you thinking._ Eran stood by Fred watching him strode off.

Senara looked at Arlen walk away, "What happened to him?" she asked, her brows furrowed and a smirk on her face.

Jason answered, "I don't know," _Looks like he messed it up._  

Elaria also left the spot, she walked to the room given by the inn keeper. Senara watched her, she then looked at Jason, "I'm going to talk to her."

Jason nodded and Senara followed Elaria to her room. He walked toward Fred, looking toward the door of the hall that led to the rooms, "What happened to him?"

Fred answered, "I don't know...," he looked at Eran, "You two stay here..., I'll go ask see him."

Jason added, "Mind if we come to?"

"No..., let's now crowd him up and..., we all know you can't resist landing jokes when Arlen is around. I don't want him to feel embarrassed."

Jason tightened his lips and nodded, "Fine, we'll stay here," he answered in a low voice.

Fredrick then walked toward the room. Eran and Jason took the seats on the table, having their own chatter before going to sleep.

***

The room was lit by the lamp above the door, one by the window was not lit. The curtain on it had been closed by Arlen. He sat on his bed, leaning forward, head low, elbows resting on his knees and fingers curled into the other. He heard a knock on the door just a moment before it creaked it open. He raised to look at it, only to see Fredrick enter the room. He closed the door behind him as he walked toward Arlen. Both looking at each other.

"What happened there?" Fred asked as he stepped toward him, his voice low.

Arlen answered, "I've embarrassed myself," sighing, he put his hands on his face, his palms rubbed against it as they slipped down.

"You haven't embarrassed yourself, you just made the move..., apparently at the wrong time," he replied. He then sat beside Arlen on the bed, and put his hand on his back. He smiled as he added, "Look..., we know how you feel for her. This stuff happens in Love and I've been through this as well, you know it better."

Arlen closed his eyes took a long and deep breath. It seemed to have lowered the burden he felt in his chest at that time. He looked at him, "You're right, I remember..., but..., that was different."

Fred furrowed his brows, the smile still there on his face, "How's that different? From this."

Arlen swallowed and pulled in his lower lip by tongue. He then let out a sigh before answering, "It is different because you both liked each other..., she felt the same for you, that's why."

"I don't see any difference any here."

"How?"

"Well..., clearly she thinks of you. If it wasn't like that you two wouldn't have been talking to each other like that, every time we stopped for rest."

"It doesn't mean she feels the same," Arlen said, his brows tightening. 

"I can bet you she does..., if not yet she will soon," he added. "Tell me..., has she ever avoided you? Whenever you walked toward her to talk."

"No."

"See? If she didn't feel the same or..., for now didn't think good about you. Why would she always be there when you went to her?"

"Maybe she only sees it as..., I don't know..., like if a friend would talk to her," Arlen stuttered.

Fred rolled his eyes as he let a sigh out. He asked, "You're whining about what happened in the hall right?"

"I shouldn't have tried to grab her hand," Arlen answered his gaze at the shelf in front.

"You pulled your back first, she didn't."

"I shouldn't have done that in the first place," Arlen's voice raised a bit but not enough for anyone outside to notice.

"It's right you made an early move. Just don't feel bad or embarrassed about it now. What's done is done," Fred wrapped his arm around Arlen's shoulder and pulled him close. He then whispered, "It's mistakes like that move things forward."

Arlen smiled as Fred lifted his arm from Arlen's shoulder. "Like the ones you made when we were young," he said, looking at him. Fredrick grinned. Arlen then added, "She doesn't know you're coming along by the way."

"She would expect at least."

"Maybe a letter or something..., but it's a good thing you're coming. The journey has been more fun with you and Jason along and..., Victoria will be happy to see you as well."

"Yes..., but we won't be staying for too long."

"Who said that? You're staying till the Spring Festival doesn't end. I didn't bring you two to just have a visit of the Capital."

"Look..., we'd love to but..., you know we have to be back at home and...,"

"So you'll disobey the Prince?"

"No..."

"Then you'll stay..., and when Bloomrise starts, I'll send for Lord William and Lady Olivia to come to Zevaragrad as well."

"But we still have a month between this and Bloomrise."

"So...? Won't you like to spend a couple months with her? and..., us."

Fredrick grinned as he put his fist on his chest and lowered his head, "As you wish...," he looked at Arlen with a smile, "Your..., Highness."

Arlen smiled and put his elbow around Fred's neck, not tightly. The door creaked open and they both looked at it. Jason, a peeled orange is his hand and Eran walked in grinning. 

"So now the Prince is strong enough to choke Sir Fredrick Valdrek," Jason said, as he chewed on the carpel and they stepped toward them.

Eran looked at Jason, "You said no jokes..., when we go inside."

Jason swallowed down the carpel and answered, "I said that because I thought he'd still be sad about what happened there," he put his fingers on his lips before he pointed at Arlen and added, "Look at him..., he's fine now."

Arlen snatched the orange Jason was holding in his hand. "Give me that..., you've eaten enough since we came in here."

"Here goes the last one," Jason said as he stared at Arlen toss it into his mouth.

"Not the last one...," Eran showed him the two more he had in his hand behind his back.

"You said you didn't have any liar," Jason said as he rushed toward him.

"I brought them for these two...," Eran cried as Jason took one from him, the other he saved it from him.

Jason looked at Fredrick's eyes as he was asking him to let him eat it. 

Fredrick said, "Don't give me that look...," he gestured with his fingers, "Give it to me."

Jason tossed it toward Fred who caught it and started to peel it. Eran gave the last one to Arlen. They then took off their shoes and got on the bed. Sitting in a circle they then continued their chatter. A moment between the group before the road ahead tomorrow.
