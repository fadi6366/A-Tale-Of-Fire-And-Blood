# Chapter 14 (Silence before the storm)

**One Day before the Ride west, 36th Glacivar 1701 AC**

The road was covered in orange and grey, the setting sun throwing it's light through the treeline. Dried out leaves crackled under the horse hooves. A cold breeze sent shivers down Elaria's skin as she rode along a few Zevaran guards and Rodion. He was sent by Queen Veyra, to not let the lady wander out unguarded. She wore a violet cloak this time due to the Zevaran customs. She had a couple dozen miles south from the Capital.

"This way, My lady," Rodion said, pointing to a small eroded passage heading off the road. Elaria pulled the reign to turn her mount. "He usually comes here, My Lady, when he wants to spend some time alone."

After riding for half a mile, Elaria's eyes caught a beautiful view of the sunlight bouncing of in the distance. Water flowing calmy down toward the setting sun. The splashing sound of the flow was a treat to the ears. She pushed the strands of her hair aside from her face. Elaria then pulled the reigns of her horse after seeing a couple guards standing by their mounts. Two more horses tied to the trees. 

Elaria gestured Rodion to stay there, he respectfully nodded. She then swung off her horse, the guard grabbed the reign from her hand. She uncovered her head as she saw Arlen and Eran sitting by the creek, laughing and tossing out pebbles in turns. The golden evening light falling on his bright face, his hair covering some of his neck.

She slowly walked toward them, a dry leaf creaked under her shoe. Both the brothers turned around and saw her. Eran gave his brother a nod before he stood up and walked her way. "Look who showed up," Eran remarked. Arlen gave a polite smirk.

"Did I disturb the Princes?" Elaria asked him teasingly.

"No, not really. It seems he likes being bothered by a cute foreign lady," he replied. Arlen turned his head forward, catching his forehead. He then looked at Rodion, "There comes Commander Trifon's favourite." Rodion's lips curved to a smile, Eran approached him and he bowed before they shook hands.

Arlen stood up as she approached. "Hi," he said in a soft voice as he let out a breath.

"Hey," she replied, in a low voice with a smile.

"Seems like you're getting used to the cold here," he said.

Elaria stepped ahead and sat down by the flowing water, "Being on the road for so long does make it feel normal."

Arlen gave her a nod, smiling as her sat down. "How's the trade setup going?"

"Well, I haven't got any word from Senara, yet. She might be busy, it takes time for a new centre to settle," she answered.

"Yes...," he curled his lip, "yes it does."

She looked at his eyes, "It seems like a big day tomorrow, you'll ride to another campaign."

His smile fainted, "Yes," he tightened his jaw tightened. "It does feel big, it's just another one of those border raids, I don't feel like it's gonna be much."

"You're scared," she said.

"No, I'm not," he furrowed his brow as his mouth widened to smile.

"Don't lie, your eyes tell everything, well at least I know enough after seeing them for weeks now," she said.

Arlen looked down at the creak, his grin wide. He let out a breath, "Is that the thing you see in them?" he asked looking at her.

She blinked quickly, "What do you mean?"

"I asked a simple question, you said you can see it in my eyes," he said. "Tell me what else do you see?"

Elaria's gaze turned down, her cheeks reddened with a smile on her face. "You know it very well," she whispered, her heart racing. A warmth spread through her chest, maybe this was what she had missed all her life without her mother.

"I know what?" he asked.

She hit him softly in the hip with the back of her hand. "Stop it," she said, controlling a quite laugh.

He noticed her face redden and the small smile tug at her lips, he couldn't help but grin softly. Arlen then said, looking at his feet, "You know," she looked at him. "I've never been with anyone, well not like this at least," he turned toward her.

"And," she looked into his dark brown eyes. "Why is that?" she asked.

"I don't know, maybe no body was worth it," he said softly.

"Worth what?" she asked lifting a brow.

"Worth...," he paused, his eyes flickered around. "What, I felt that day. When," he let out a sigh. "I saw you step out that carriage..." 

"Maybe you aren't the only one who felt it," she murmured, her voice soft. Their gaze locked, the world seemed to have faded around them. The soft sound of the splash as the creek flowed. A cool breeze brushed both their hair on their face.

"If you two love birds are done chirping, we could head home then?" Eran said, standing a few paces away. Both of them broke gaze as they looked at him. They laughed as the gaze met for a moment again. Arlen stood, stretching his leg. 

He gave her his hand, a warm smile on his face. She grabbed it. He felt the warmth of her soft palm, his heart skipped a beat. He then pulled politely as she stood up. Arlen gestured to walk ahead and then followed. He brushed Eran's hair with fingers quickly with a grin before wrapping it around his shoulders.

Arlen gestured to the guard as they approached the horses. The guard nodded and he untied a sword from the saddle. The sheath made out of leather, colour dark with a small rubie at the side of the handle. Flowers petals carved around the gem. The hilt also resembling the beauty of the sheath, with a red tassel swinging as he grabbed the sword from him. 

Elaria looked at it, her eyes narrowed a bit. She was mesmerized from the beauty of it.

Arlen then stepped toward her grabbing it from both hands toward each end. "I told the blacksmith to have it made, the day we arrived at the Capital," he looked at it. "It seems he did exactly as I told him."

She looked at him, he gestured her to take it. Elaria then grabbed the blade from his hand. She took it out of the sheath. The metal gave a bright shine from the sunlight bouncing from it. It was perfect for her, light enough to swing easily and sharp enough to cut cleanly through flesh.

"He usually goes home by the time we would have returned from here," he said. Elaria turned toward him. "I took it from him when we left, thought of giving it to you at night, but you came yourself, so there was no reason to-"

"It's truly beautiful, I never thought a weapon could be as pretty as this one," she remarked.

"It depends one the who asks for it to be forged, the smiths only follow orders, My Lady," both of them turned after hearing the words from Rodion. He stepped closer and met Arlen's gaze, "A weapon is a reflection of one's heart." He gave Arlen a nod, faintly winking as they broke gaze.

Arlen smiled, then took a breath. He then said loudly, "Alright, let's head home, it'll get colder by dusk."

All the guards nodded with their fists on the chest. Eran approached Arlen, he whispered after Arlen lowered his head, "What did she say?"

"I'll tell you later," he answered, whispering. Elaria watched Eran's curiosity. 

Eran nodded. Everyone then mounted their horses. Arlen splashed the reigns, sharing a glance with Elaria, both smiled. He then splashed his harder this time and the stallion started to run. Everyone followed. Riding toward the Capital. 

As the wind tugged at her cloak, and the sunset painted the road ahead. Elaria reminded herselt that beneath all the warmth and shared emotions she was still a spy. Though the ice had started to crack, she couldn't ignore the actual purpose of her voyage to the Capital.

***

At the west, it was different. The dusk bid it's farewell for the day, and the horizon grew dark. A dozen soldiers strode around what remained of Grunmore, another village that was burnt to the ground by the western raiders. 

Smoke rose from the burnt huts, flames rising from some of them. The air thick with the smoke making it harder to breath in some corners of the village. Their shoes covered in mud and blood. The raids from the riders were so fast and swift that by the time Varangian guard would arrive at the targeted spot, they would be long gone. This one was another example of that.

The pathway was full of decapitated corpses and dead children. The guards even saw a few unborn that had been cut out from the wombs. A devastating sight to watch even for the strong hearted soldiers like them. The smell of the dead and smoke made even standing there feel like hell. 

Gaedric who was one of the Varangian guard and a skilled archer, roamed around with the village. He had his arrow drawn in case of anything unusual. He swallowed as his gaze caught on those corpses, heart felt like it would give up on the moment, throat dry. "Look for anyone living," he shouted. "If they had spared them," he added in a low voice. 

Gaedric's eye caught at a hut at which the fire had suddenly gone out. He narrowed his eyes, moments later the same thing happened to a couple more huts nearby. He quickly rushed to see what had happened. What he saw completely shocked him. An arrow was landed there, ice spread from it's tip, a few paces around it turned. 

He heard another one loose in the distance, his eye caught at it as it hissed through the air, glowing, as it shot the burnt wood, freezing it. The ice spread and the fire in a couple moments, gone. "You see that?" Gaedric said to his friend, Irric.

"I do, what is it?" Irric answered. 

Gaedric shook his head. "Look, it froze the wood around it. The fire also gone," He added, narrowing his eyes.

"Look at the mist coming out of it," Irric said, a bit louder. "Look it's like a lamp going off."

Gaedric nodded. He turned toward the bushes, "there, I think they're coming from there." He gestured a couple of soldiers to go and see. They nodded and slowly walked toward the bushes. Gaedric stood and watched as they entered the dark bushed, holding a torch and sword in hands.

Irric stepped toward Gaedric, "It looks like God sent us aid. I don't think whatever this was, it meant us harm."

"You're right, it took out the flames, but we can't be so sure, this might also be a warning."

A few moments later, the bushes rattled. Both Gaedric and Irric turned their gaze forward. Both the guards emerged. 

"Nothing commander," the guard said.

"We saw foot prints but they vanished," the other one added.

Gaedric and Irric met gaze, a sudden chill ran down their spine.

"Let's head back to Greywatch, we have to inform the commander," Gaedric said.

Irric nodded and yelled, "We're heading back, come on."

Gaedric took one of those arrows out from the wood. "We'll show it to him, if it's something trying to help us, I'm sure it will come again. If it's anything else, we'll need to know about it."

The soldiers rushed toward their horses, shoes splashing in the mud. Gaedric looked at toward the bushes. _Whatever it was, we have to find out._ 

Back at Greywatch, Miron sat in the mess-hall, having his dinner. A cooked dear along with fried corn. The door swung open, a young boy stepped in. Miron's gaze turned toward him.

"Commander, the scouts have returned," he said.

Miron pushed his chair back and stood up. He strode quickly toward the door. Gaedric and Irric along with the rest of the scouts had arrived. Miron looked at their faces and knew that something was not right.

Gaedric walked toward him and bowed. He then took out an arrow from his sack. The tip frozen and a subtle glow coming from it. Miron took it in his hands, he gazed at it sharply.

"Someone shot these at the burning huts, commander," Gaedric said, catching his breath. Miron looked at him. "They were glowing, mist coming out of them as they froze the wood around them and took out the fire."

Miron closely examined the tip of the arrow. "It does looks like flint," he said. "You said it froze the wood around it," he looked at Gaedric. Gaedric nodded. "Then this is work of magic, arrows don't normally take out entire fires."

Miron let out a sigh, "We're definitely not the only ones fighting those savages out here."

"Or they are not the only ones fighting us," Gaedric remarked. Miron's brows furrowed as he looked at him. "I mean, they could be warning us."

"If they were here to warn, us. Then they would shot a couple ones of us," Miron said. 

Irric approached, "It seems like God did sent us an aid before the help from the Capital arrives."

Miron nodded, "Alright, we'll look into it, send a group of scouts to look out for this magical friend of ours as well. If they want to help us, they might as well consider showing themself."

Gaedric nodded and he gestured to a nearby soldier. The man nodded and walked away, to give the order to the other scouts. 

Half a dozen horses left as before the main gate was swung close by the guards. The figure watched them from a far, sitting on a tree branch high up. The violet glowing eyes saw the scouts leave Greywatch.

Back at Zevaragrad, the Prince along with his companion Fredrick was in the war room. Commanders Rodion, Nikolai and Trifon were alongside making up the strategy for the march west. The room lit by the torches, lamps and one placed on the corner of the table. They had it surrounded with a map. Arlen's eyes traced it, examining the sketch of the territory they will march toward.

He placed his finger on a city marked on the map. "Ironette," everyone looked at him. "We can use this point to split our forces before we march further ahead."

"Why splitting up?" Rodion furrowed his brow as he asked. Nikolai looked at Arlen.

"We're heading straight into territory most of us aren't familiar with, even though it's under our control," Arlen swallowed as paused. "In case, of any mischief," Nikolai clenched his jaw. "I don't want all of us to be targeted."

_He's making a mistake_ Fredrick looked at Arlen, he let out a sigh. "But they'll be coming at us while we're weak and scattered. It puts us all at risk."

Trifon nodded, "Your friend is right my Prince. This is a risky-"

"But we'll reach there quick," Arlen cut off Trifon. He was trying to do what they did back in the southern war. But that was a different situation, unfortunate for the commanders the Prince was had too much belief in his strategies that he wouldn't listen.

"They why don't we leave the Capital in smaller columns?" Nikolai asked, his hand on his chin.

"That's right, if you want speed, we must leave the Capital in smaller columns," Fredrick said, gesturing with his hand.

Arlen looked at Fredrick, "Look-"

Trifon cut the Prince off, "Your Highness, they are right. You're going unified while marching in safer lands, but you'll split up when the danger is near."

Everyone nodded, looking at each other. 

Arlen blinked his eyes, he let out a sigh. Placing his hands on the table he said, looking at Trifon, "Teacher, I respect your opinion." He gazed at the everyone, "I respect everyone's opinion, but what I'm saying is that if we enter those lands as one, a large force can easily be spotted."

"Even if they spot us, they won't be taking on arms with a couple thousand imperial soldiers," Fredrick said.

"He's right, they won't," Rodion replied.

Arlen paused for a moment, then he said, "Reaching there in pieces is better than not arriving at all. If they spot the whole force, they can setup a bigger ambush. I know it's a risk splitting up, but that goes both ways. We're already risking it by not taking a larger army."

_He won't listen_ Trifon turned his gaze down.

"Then why not take a larger force?" Nikolai asked, squinting his brows.

"It will slow us down," Arlen answered. "If we need more, we can send word to nearby cities there or." He looked at Trifon, "Teacher," Trifon's gaze lifted toward Arlen. "You can ride with four thousand, behind us. But the soldiers will disguise themselves as they cross the Black Peaks."

_What's he doing?_ Fredrick looked at Arlen, his forehead lining up.

Arlen pointed with his finger, "Grangnach Ridge, this is the city between the peaks. We will cross the Black Peaks from here." He looked at Trifon, "and Teacher, you will bring your men from Hillrightgate." He pointed with his finger to a city marked miles north from Grangnach. "From here, you'll ride to Orrmire and then Wenmore. You'll leave a couple weeks after us." He straightened. "If we're spotted their focus will be on us, while you will take the northern road and reach greywatch from Wenmore."

The commanders looked at each other, _Finally he came up with something good._ Fredrick looked at Arlen, his lip curved to a smile.

Arlen swallowed, "If they take out our vanguard, then it will be Commander Trifon's force that will take care of them."

The door creaked open, they turned to look. It was the soldier who brought the message to Theron. He bowed to Arlen, the Prince nodded. Fredrick explained him the strategy they made so far to him.

After listening he looked at Arlen and said, "Your Highness, it's not my place to give suggestions. But, I will advise your force to change your routes."  Arlen gestured him to tell them by pointing at the map. "Grangnach is good to cross the Black Peaks. If you want to split the forces than don't send them on similar routes." Arlen tilted his head, narrowing his eyes. "You can send half of your men from Karawood to Ironette, and half of them to Ravmoryn. There you can do however you please, Your Highness. Take them together or further splitting them."

They all looked at the Prince because the final call was his to make. He stood there, staring at the map, rubbing his fingers at his jaw. "Fine, Commander Rodion, me and Fredrick will take the route to Ironette. From there, Rodion will travel to Grimwood, while me and Fredrick will the troops directly to Greywatch."

The soldier then spoke, "Your Highness, this is the riskier route, but since you're convinced to take it. I know a few roads that they will likely not be targeting us on."

Arlen nodded, with a smile. "Then it's settled then, you'll ride with us and when we leave Ironette we'll ride on the roads you tell us."

The soldier nodded and took out a detailed map of the region, he placed it on the table. Pointing with his fingers he showed Arlen and everyone there the roads ideal for Arlen and Rodion to take. The Prince was satisfied and all of them agreed. 

Trifon being experienced and the older one still had doubts but he knew Arlen won't listen after he's made up his mind. His strategies had paid them off well in the past, this was a gamble as well, all he could do was to hope it paid off.

After the decisions were made for the upcoming campaign. Fred went to visit Victoria, whom he would attempt to tie knot with. He knocked the door of her room. 

"Yes?" the faint voice came from inside. He pushed the door slowly, it creaked as it swung open. He entered the room, and saw her. Victoria on her bed staring at the window, looking at the glass covered in mist. Fred closed the door behind him. 

"You're not gonna stop are you? From going with him." She said, her tone sad and disappointed, holding back her tears.

"You know very well, your brother doesn't seem going anywhere without me," Fred replied, warm tone. He stepped close and sat beside her. Wrapping his arm around her shoulders. "Are you crying?"

A few drops ran down her cheek. "Promise me," she looked at him. "Promise me, you'll return home safe, and bring him as well."

He smiled, "Don't worry, nothing will happen to us. We'll be back home before Verdalis begins," he tilted his head toward her, touching her. "And, we're gonna get married the day I lay feet in the Capital."

"And if you don't? she asked, in a low voice."

"You don't trust me?"

"I do but, this duty of yours' at west, it worries me. We don't know what is lurking out there, that my Father is sending you after."

"It's just some bandits, irritating the borders, nothing else. Don't worry, we'll return home as soon as we have delt with them."

Victoria straightened, letting go of Fred's arm around her. She didn't speak for a while. Swallowing before she said, "Take care of yourself and Arlen out there, I don't want to loose either of you two," looking at him.

Fredrick wiped her cheek with his thumb, "Your brother is a pain in the &&& yes. But he's my brother as well, and after you if there is anything I care about in this world. It's that knucklehead."

She chuckled as she grabbed her hand, gazing into his eyes, forgetting the tension of the outside world for a brief moment. Fredrick said, "It's late now, we should get some sleep." She gave a subtle nod. Fredrick then wrapped his arms around her. A warm embrace between the two before they let go. He then stood up and walked out, heading toward his chamber to get rest before the upcoming task tomorrow. 

Victoria stared at the window, looking at the faint moonlight that crept through. _May God be with you both._  

***

Queen Veyra stood at the balcony, watching the courtyard below as Fredrick climbed down the stairs and entered. Arlen and Eran were already there, chattering. The Palace gate stood open. Torches lighting up the yard, the gold also falling on the young lads standing at the centre of the yard, covered in their cloaks. Arlen, the daring soul he was didn't have his head covered despite the cold at night.

She watched in silence as Fred approached them, clapping fist with Arlen before pulling him into an embrace. A couple moments they let go. The heir laughed, mouth wide enough for his teeth to show. Her lip curved at the lower five by Eran to Fredrick. _He's like a big brother to them._

Footsteps approached, and a soft cough. It was King Theron, stepped forward and halted beside the Queen. 

"His laugh looks more heart-warming when he is about to head for war," she said.

"Not the first time, he's shown what he's capable of," Theron remarked.

"It's still the same feeling everytime, for a mother watching her boy walking into war," she replied.

Theron's gaze turned at Fredrick, who threw his head back, leaning forward with laughter. "The Valdrek lad is good, isn't he? Always by our son's side."

"They grew up together," she paused, smiling. "In front of our eyes, I always felt like he was our own." 

"He was lucky to have this lad by him," Theron met Veyra's gaze. "Loyalty is rare these days, no one rides with you into fire, expecting nothing in return."

Veyra's gaze turned toward them, "Speaking of loyalty, he's with our daughter as well."

"Yes, that's no secret, they don't hide it from anyone."

"I think it's time we should think about it, Victoria has grown up now," she said.

"Let them return home, if the Valdreks come to ask for her hand," Theron straightened. "I do like the lad."

"God bring them back safely," Veyra said.

"God bring them back safely," Theron said, nodding.

Veyra then looked at Arlen, as he shook hands with Fredrick, followed by Eran before all three of them walked toward their rooms. For a couple moments the King and the Queen stood there at the balcony before they also went toward their royal chamber. Despite the cold there was a subtle warmth in the night, a perfect silence before the storm.

***

**The Next Day, 1st Snowtide 1701 AC**

A cloudy day at the Capital, faint sunlight crept through the clouds, as Dawn welcomed the morning hour. A cold wind blew slowly. Rodion and Nikolai stood near the Palace gate, holding the rein of their mounts. Inside and across the courtyard, Arlen stood on the steps staring at the horizon, hands crossed behind his back. The breeze brushed his hair on his face. _So, this is it. The day I ride to war by myself,_ his gaze lowered, _Without Darius, or Father beside me,_ he swallowed. 

Fredrick approached from behind, he gave Arlen a gentle pat on his back. Arlen turned his head, meeting his gaze. Arlen put his hand across Fred's shoulder, both shared a warm smile. "You know you can, stay back if you want. Your Mother won't be pleased when she hears you've gone with me, again."

"Did that ever stop me before," Fred replied. "Besides, I can't let you ride out and have all the fun alone."

Arlen smiled, letting out a sigh he said, "We don't know, what awaits us. We haven't been there for our whole life. I don't want to put you in danger," a subtle worry in his eyes as he met Fred's gaze.

"And I can't let you ride into danger alone," Fred replied, brushing Arlen's hair.

"I told you not to do that," Arlen said, grabbing Fred's hand.

"You sure love your hair," Fred said, letting out a chuckle.

Arlen's word faded from his lips as they heard footsteps and turned their gaze toward them. It was Victoria, wearing her dark royal attire. Looking at them as she approached. Arlen looked at Fred, the corner of his lip curved. 

She paused a few steps away, wishing they could stay. The thought of both of them riding into another war tightened her chest.

Meanwhile, at the west of the Black Peaks. In a small town a few miles from Greywatch. The figure strode across the market, covered in a dark cloak. Their eyes scanning the crowd, vigilant as always. Stopping by a merchant's stall, they picked up an apple, examining it. The merchant looked at them, "You want that?"

The figure didn't answer, they reached out for the coins in the sack. Six silver coins tossed out from their palm on the merchant's counter. "That'll buy you two," he said. The figure tossed half a dozen more coins. The merchant then put four apples in a small bag. He handed them over to them. 

"Please, don't..., hurt me. Here..., take it all," a man cried in a distance. His voice trembling under fear as he shivered. A thief had pointed a dagger at him, asking him to give away the money he had. The figure turned around, their violet eyes stared as the thief took the money from the man. The figure narrowed their eyes, and the money sack dropped from the thief's hand.

He started to cry in pain, as he felt his hand suddenly freeze. The man's eyes opened wide, yet he didn't bother to think what happened. He just knelt, took his money and then sprinted away. The mysterious figure stared, their lip curving to a smile as the thief cried in pain.

"Mne prishlos'," the figure whispered. _I had to._

The thief cried out loud as the frozen hand started to twist slowly. People had started to gather around him, surprised. "What in the world happened to him," the merchant from behind the figure.

"Khorosho, ya yego otpushchu," the figure whispered. _Fine, I'll let him go._ Their eyes relaxed. The thief's cries faded out as he felt his hand back. The freeze was gone, but the pain from the curls still there. He stood up, didn't meet anyone's gaze, holding it in his other hand he ran away.

"What kind of act was this?" an older man shouted. A man nearby him nodded and they all started murmuring, looking at the humiliated thief run away.

The figure pulled their cloak down, completely hiding the face and walked away slowly. "YA sdelal eto, potomu chto eto bylo neobkhodimo," they whispered. _I did it because it was necessary._ "YA ne mog pozvolit' yemu soyti s ruk eto,"  _I couldn't let him get away with it_. 

They walked a few paces. Letting out a sigh they whispered, "Khorosho, ya bol'she tak ne budu delat'." _Fine, i wont do it again._ 

The people at the market still in shock, what could have happened with that thief. A couple of them stared at the figure as they stepped away. For a moment thinking it was them, but didn't dare speak out.

"YA yego ne nashla, on yeshcho ne prosnulsya," the figure a bit louder this time, after walking out of the town. _I haven't found him, it hasn't woken up yet._ They took the apple out from the bag, and took a bite from it. The shoes splatted in the puddles, as they strode off.

Back at the Capital, the courtyard was now buzzing as everyone had arrived to see the Prince off. 

Both of them mounted on their horses. Arlen's gaze meeting with his mother.

Theron stepped forward, Arlen, Fred and both the commanders turned their gaze at him.

Theron cleared his throat, his hand in front of his mouth. "Today you ride West. The Vargoth seemed to have risen again. They have sent their hounds into our lands," Arlen's grip tightened on the rein. "It seems they have forgotten who the Zevarans are. We'll remind them well," Arlen gave a subtle nod.

Theron continued, "This might not be like the battles you've fought before," Fred looked at Victoria. "These raiders are not like any army you've won against," Arlen straightened his neck. "But that shouldn't make you loose spirit, you are the sons of Zevaran, our ancestors fought those savages and conquered the Western lands. You will now fight them to save those lands." Arlen's gaze met Elaria, he swallowed.

"May God be with you," Theron gestured with his hand.

Arlen yelled as he snapped the rein, his horse lifted it's both front legs with a loud neigh. Veyra looked at him, she smiled proudly, Elaria's heart raced. Julia's grip tightened on a book she held on her chest. He then turned it toward the gate and it galloped out, followed by Fredrick and the commanders. 

Their horses neighed as they galloped across the Capital road. The thunder of the hooves shook the street nearby. Two thousand Zevaran men riding behind the heir. The main gate of the city pushed open as they approached. The guards squinted his eyes from the dust rising off the hooves. 

The gate was pushed close as the last man rode out. The violet Zevaran banners whipped in the air as the horsemen rode. Arlen and Fred met gaze as their mounts stepped on the Red Road, turning westward. The warriors have now ridden off, this would be a huge test for the Prince, riding without his brothers and Father for the first time.
