 
# Chapter 12 (The Court Day)

**The Next day...,**

The horizon faintly lit before dawn approached. Cold wind rustled the dry leaves on the trees. The gold of the torches and lamps covered the gallery and balconies in the Palace. The room was warm though, only the faint moonlight could pass through the window and the gap between the curtains.

Arlen lied on his bed with the warm and soft blanket over him. His eyes tightened and brows furrowed, his head shaking by the moment. It was another one of those nightmares. He kept on taking turn. His heart started to beat faster, hand gripped tightly on the sheet. This time something else was happening in his dream.

Arlen stood in the remains of the village. The white torn tunic covered his body, his feet bare and cold. "MURDERER...., MUDERER....," the ghosts who were surrounding him chanting. But this time instead of everything getting engulfed by flames, something different happened. 

The voices stopped suddenly. Arlen raised his head as he moved his hand away from his face. He looked around and saw everyone disappeared. He stood up and took a few steps ahead. "ARLEN...., ARLEN....," a voice echoed from the distance. Arlen turned around to see who was chanting his name. 

His eyes caught at the horizon. The blue slowly faded into a reddish orange colour. His eyes sharpened as he saw the sun slowly turn red. Before he could understand what was happening his eyes opened. His heart raced as he got up. He sat with the blanket covering his legs, his chest burning even more this time. He put his hand on it as he struggled with the pain.

_What was that?_ The dream he had was different this time. He had never heard someone chanting his name before. He looked at the window, faint light creeping through the curtain. When his chest stopped burning he pushed the blanket away and got up. _I need some air._ He wrapped his cloak around and walked toward the door. The hinges creaked as he pulled it open. The cold brushed against his cheek.

Arlen stepped out and closed the door behind him. He walked across the hallway, his steps echoed in the calm of the night. _What was it? What did it mean? What were those chants?_ His mind flashed the dream he saw as his steps echoed. His gaze lingered on the Phoenix carvings on the pillars as he strode ahead. _Is it all actually true?_  

Arlen politely pushed the door open toward the outer gallery. He looked at the faint moonlight and the gold of the torches falling on the walls and pillars. He closed the door and took a few steps ahead, resting his arms on the railing. His eyes caught at a figure appearing in the gallery just across the courtyard. He rubbed his eyes with his fingers to see clearly. It was Elaria.

She saw the Prince looking at her and gave him a nod. Arlen gazed at her as she walked across the gallery, toward him.

"Couldn't sleep?" Elaria asked as she halted just near him.

He shook his head, "No....," looking at her he asked, "You? you're also awake."

Elaria let out a sigh, "Yeah..., just woke up."

Arlen stretched lowering his head, hands still holding on the rail. He let out a sigh and nodded. He straightened and turned toward her. "Can I ask what woke you up?"

"Nothing..., it just..., happens sometimes. I wake up at night..., mostly before dawn."

Arlen let out a smirk, "Seems like another thing we have in common."

Elaria asked, "How? Does it happen to you as well?"

Arlen nodded, "Yes..., it's been happening for a while now."

"Why? What has been happening?"

"Nothing..., just like you said. I also wake up at this time before...," _wait..., is this because of those dreams?_ Arlen tightened his jaw, turning his eyes away from her.

"Why did you stop? Is something wrong?"

"No..., I just...," he took a pause and turned his gaze at the moon.

She watched as Arlen looked at it.

He met Elaria's eyes and held the gaze for a long moment, as if seeking the courage to speak. Arlen took a deep breath before speaking, "I have been having this..., dream for a while now."

Elaria's brows tightened. She asked, "What dream?"

Arlen broke his gaze, his eyes flickered around. He didn't speak for a moment. 

Elaria watched the Prince, she waited for him to reply.

"I have been seeing things..., things I can't quiet explain," he said, breaking the silence. 

"What things?"

_What do I tell her?_ He blinked as his eyes caught her gaze. _That the ones I killed come to haunt me._ "Things I'm not quiet proud off." 

"What could be that you are not proud off?" she asked teasingly.

"You said you've heard about the war south."

She nodded, "Yes. What are you not proud off. You won the war right?"

"We did," his brows furrowed. "But..." he paused.

Elaria gestured with her eyes, holding the gaze.

"Look..., whatever stories you've heard about me are things our people and my Father see. Not what I saw and the ones who lost did."

"And what is that?"

"During the war....," he swallowed. "We raided villages and towns. The ones near the borders, to get food and other things."

"Is that what haunts you? Taking food from them?" she asked.

He shook his head, "We killed them all. The ones who didn't even have any weapons. We cut them all down. Children..., women..., innocents..., ALL OF THEM. I...," he let out a sigh. "I walked up to a brother and sister..., they were..., younger than Eran..., maybe even half his age." His eyes almost teared up. "Their mother was right there..., watching..., as I grabbed the boy and...," he closed his eyes and sighed.

Elaria grabbed his arm softly. "It's okay..., if you don't want..., don't say it. I think I know what happened next."

Arlen took a deep breath. "That's what haunts me..., they come at night in my dreams and remind me of what I am. Even if everyone sees a Prince who won them the South. They don't see the innocents he cut down. The ones who couldn't fight..."

As he was pouring his guilt out. Elaria spoke, "You're not what you think. Whatever you did there is past now. And..., as far as I've seen you. You're nothing like what you think, well not anymore."

Arlen nodded and let out a sigh. As he was about to put his hand on her, she let go of his arm. He also pulled his hand, curling his fingers. Both of them didn't speak for a few moments.

Arlen rested his arms on the rail. He looked down at the yard and asked, "So..., you didn't tell me what's been waking you up."

Elaria curled her lips, swallowing, she looked at the moon. "You know about my mother." She said, crossing her arms, leaning on the pillar.

"Yes..., do you see her?"

"No..., I see the door of that medics room..., I hear screams from inside it..., and then...," she paused.

"And then what?" He looked at her and raised a brow.

"Nothing...," she shook her head, looking down.

He tightened his jaw, letting out his breath from his nose, the cold wind brushing his cheeks. He stayed silent for a while then met her gaze. "Guess we're both haunted by the ghosts of our past."

Her eyes blinked, breaking the gaze as she nodded. 

"You miss her?" Arlen asked, breaking the silence.

Elaria swallowed, she turned toward balcony rail. Her arms crossed, eyes caught at the moon. "Everyday, every night, I just..., I wish she was alive. I want to know how it felt, growing up, having your mother there by you."

Arlen let out a sigh, "I understand your...."

"No...," she cut him off, her voice lower now. "You don't..., no one does..., no one understands the pain of a motherless child," her heart raced, breath galloped.

He didn't say anything, he just looked at her as she gazed outside. She was not wrong either, Arlen could've felt pain but not the loss of a mother.

Her eyes wet with tears, her throat tight, but she held it back. Not wanting to weep in front of the Prince, but a few slipped down her cheek. She took in a deep breath with her eyes closed and let it out as she opened them.

Arlen grabbed his cloak and he gently wiped them off her face. At his touch, Elaria blinked, shaking her head and tilting back slightly. He pulled his hand back.

"I think we should go to sleep," she said, looking toward him.

Arlen nodded, without a word. Elaria did the same as she turned and walked toward her room. He watched as she strode away, her steps echoing in the silence. Arlen looked at the sky. It was an important morning tomorrow as the King would hold court to meet the envoy.

***

**The next Morning...**

"ALL HEIL KING THERON, ALL HEIL KING THERON..." Everyone in the court hall chanted as Theron entered and approached the Throne. He climbed the dias, turned around and curled his fist. The chants faded as he sat beneath the head of the Phoenix. The wings spread wide on the sides.

Arlen stood on the right of the dias, among a couple courtiers and commanders, Rodion stood beside him. Opposite to them stood the guests. Azekial, his face cold, gaze steady and focused on the King. Elaria, her hands crossed in front, met gaze with Arlen. Senara beside her, her eyes searching for Jason who seemed to be not present at the court. A few paces to their left stood Julian, waiting for the court to commence.

Beside the King stood Darius. Queen Veyra had taken her seat beside Theron's just before he came. After Darius's formal address for the court Theron looked at Derhvan, the head of treasury, and gestured him to come forward. Derhvan bowed and stepped forward. He halted in front of the King, a few paces from the dias and knelt. 

"Have the Kantari allies sent their tribute?" The King asked, his voice loud and a cold tone.

Julian with his knee bent, fist on his chest and head bowed answered, "Yes your majesty, we expect it to arrive by dusk." Theron's eyes turned at Azekial for a moment as Derhvan was saying this.

"By dusk? It was supposed to arrive yesterday," the King said, in a furious tone.

"Yes your majesty, but I haven't got the word about the reason, only that they will arrive a day late," Derhvan answered, raising his head and looking at the King.

Theron didn't speak for a couple moments. "Tell them to send five crates of gold more the next time, so that they remember to pay it on time."

"Yes, your majesty."

Theron gestured Julian to go back to his place.

Julian looked at him as he bowed and walked back toward it. 

Azekial took a breath, expecting Theron to call them next. Theron looked at him for a moment but then turned his gaze away. The King looked at Avenir, one of the commanders in the army and gestured with his face. 

Avenir shouted, "Bring them in."

The guards dragged in a couple prisoners, their cloths torn and face covered in dirt. They were sentenced to two years prison by the conciliator a few months ago due to their ambushes on trade convoys. They screamed loud and cried as the guards dragged them on the floor. The metal chains on their hands clanking and bodies shivering from the cold.

Arlen looked at them, _Oh God, does he have to do this?_ 

The guards pushed them and they fell on the ground a few paces from the dias. 

"Why were you captured?" the King asked them coldly.

"We..., we stole from traders," one of the prisoners answered, his voice shivered and heart raced.

Theron looked at the guard and gestured with his hand. He bowed and took out a few gold coins from the sack. He grabbed the prisoner's mouth open. He struggled and screamed as the guard filled it with the golden coins.

"You wanted gold didn't you? Now you can have it," Theron said, with a faint smile.

"He's trying to intimidate us," Azekial whispered to himself, "Son of a &&&."

After the guard had put all the coins in the prisoner's mouth. He pushed him hard as he fell on the floor. The prisoner struggled and screamed but no words could come out from a full mouth.

Theron then signalled the guard by lifting a brow. 

The guard took out his dagger. Seeing it, the prisoner's eyes widened. He looked at Theron and struggled, his hands and legs tied in metal, as if he begged him to spare his life. The guard placed the dagger at his throat, pressing it hard at the bone.

"Your majesty..., we were sent to prison for two years to be released..., we weren't..."

Theron gestured the other guard and he dragged the prisoner away from the dias.

The first one splashed his blade on the throat of the prisoner and blood splattered out on the floor. His body shook fiercely as the last essence of life left his body. 

Looking at the one being dragged away, Theron ordered, "Feed him to the hounds."

Arlen closed his eyes and let out a breath. The guests watched the King try to assert his power but they stood firm, silently watched as Theron tried to overwhelm them.

"Nothing is above the King, even the laws," the King said in a loud voice.

After a few courtiers were called by the King and a couple issues discussed he finally called the guests. Theron gestured at Azekial to step forward.

Azekial halted a few paces from the dias and bowed. He looked at the King's eyes, steady gaze without a flinch, calmly with a faint grin on his lips.

The King didn't speak, he looked at the envoy, staring coldly.  Darius who stood beside his king, stepped a couple paces down the dias. Meeting gaze with Azekial, he said, loudly, "You stand in front of King Theron, ruler of half the known world. Most powerful on the western side of the Crimson Sea."

Arlen's lip curved to a smile, despite the issues he had with how they ran the Kingdom. The pride of his heritage was still there. He looked at the envoy and his brother.

Azekial's gaze lowered for a moment, he swallowed and then looked at the Prince. "What you speak is no doubt true. The power of the Zevaran King is stranger to none. The sole reason for his Majesty, King Orestane seeks an alliance."

Julian's brow furrowed. He stepped a few steps forward, looking at Theron he asked, "Your Majesty, if you allow me, I would like to ask our noble guest a few things."

Theron nodded and gestured with his hand, giving the permission.

Julian stepped closer to Azekial.

"Aren't we already in a truce? It's been more than two decades since both the states went on arms against each other. What kind of alliance Orestane wants now?"

Azekial looked at Julian and answered, "Protection..., your highness," he turned toward the King. "Our trade convoys, they need protection Your Majesty. His highness wants us to be allowed to travel on the main travel roads in Zevaria, especially the Red Road. He also demands to be allowed to land on the Zevaran ports instead of Dawngard."

Elaria let out a sigh and met her gaze with Arlen, he smiled faintly and gestured with his eyes to not worry.

"Isn't the Dragon's bay the shortest route from Bayside landing to these lands?" Theron asked.

"It is Your Majesty, but it takes longer for the ships from the northern ports of the Shinobi. They first have to come to Bayside Landing and then set sail west. Also the Dawngard demand their own taxes when we pass from there."

"You said you need protection, but here you're trying to avoid taxes," Julian remarked.

"We do need protection Your Highness, that is why I mentioned the main trade routes. Currently, our traders go from Dragonweil to the city of Harthavene, and sell their good there. But those roads are not safe as most of the times our convoys are ambushed by bandits."

"But the Azlari traders do pass through Harthavene and trade in the southern Zevaria. Don't they?" Julian asked, slowly striding around Azekial, hands cross behind his back.

He nodded as replied, "They do, Your Highness. But like I said, those routes aren't safe...,"

"Traders from the Riverlands in the South arrive here four or five times a year. They don't get ambushed, not too often like you're saying," Theron asked. A question to trick the envoy, as the routes which they used different and lied far to the west from Harthavene.

"Your Highness, I don't know about any convoys from the Riverlands, as we know very little about other tribes that trade through Harthavene," Azekial replied.

Theron looked at Julian and gave him a subtle nod. Julian then said, "It seems you and even Orestane aren't sure about what you want."

Azekial, letting out a sigh replied, "Your Highness, like I have been saying we want our trade convoys to travel safe, and to reduce the loss we face at each trip from those bandits."

Darius tightened his jaw, as he was running out of patience. He stepped forward and said, "Get to the point Azekial, what is it that you want? Which routes?"

"Your Highness, we want to be allowed travel by the Red Road, allowed to sell ourselves in the Zevaran Capital and, allowed to trade in the Western cities."

"So Orestane wants the trade to be like the old times, before the War," Theron said.

"Yes Your Majesty, it's the dawn of a new century and his Highness wants a new beginning between the two empires."

Julian asked, "Fine let's get this straight, you want you vessels to land in the Zevaran ports instead of Dawngard."

"Yes Your Highness, we want the ships arriving from Ilantia to Carravin to sail directly to the Zevaran lands through the Pearl Bay," Azekial answered.

Theron still didn't want to give them an easy opening. The nearest city to Carravin was Eldoria, it would save them the time sailing but if they were to avoid the Dawngard lands and travel to Zevaragrad, this was the longest route on foot. For Theron this was the best choice. "If we allow you to dock in Pearl bay, what does Orestane has to offer for us," he asked.

"The ships sailing from Zevaria to Ilantia will pay one-fourth of the taxes they are paying currently at the Shinobi ports, also instead of two ships every month, Zevaria will be allowed to send five to sell their goods. You'll pay half the taxes to our markets when you trade in Ilantia."

"What about the raiders that raid the southern city of Korvossa at the Islebray Island?" Julian asked.

"The Azlari galleys at Tornavell will keep watch of the waters around the Korvosso port, any raiding vessel will be sunk beneath the Crimson waters." Azekial answered.

Theron gestured Julian to not bother answering, he thought for a few moments. Azekial's eyes flickered around, from the King to the companions who travelled alongside him. The rest of the negotiations relied upon Theron agreeing or not.

Elaria's heart raced she took a deep breath.

Theron looked at Azekial, letting a slow smile curl at the corner of his mouth.  
"Fine..., you can dock your ships at Eldoria instead of Dawngard." He paused, his eyes flickered at Arlen, who himself switched his gaze between Elaria and his father. 
"Then ride northwest to Craigmorne." Theron’s gaze flicked to Julian, who nodded.  

"And, like you said, to avoid Dawngard," he looked at Azekial, who stared right at him, his eyes narrowed, something clicking in his mind. "You’ll ride to Ashenfall, then take the Red Road to Hallowthorn and Thalenor, and finally Elmorne, the closest city to the Capital." He leaned back slightly, gesturing with his hand.

The first part of their objective was achieved, this was exactly what they wanted. Theron had granted them the route, even though the longest one but it was enough. Azekial then presented the rest of the terms and a letter sent by Orestane. Theron listened and negotiated, Julian intervened, some were rejected and some were accepted. The King gave some counter terms as well, that Azekial unwillingly had to accept.

***

Theron then glanced at Elaria, he called her to come forward. Elaria stepped forward, halting in front of the dias, she bowed. Theron's eyes followed her as she walked, Arlen letting out a sigh looking at her.

"Cassimar hasn't sent his daughter without a reason, tell me what do they want?" he asked.

"Your Highness, Lord Azekial has already discussed most of what we came to ask for," she lowered her head. "First I express my gratitude in front of the ruler of these lands for accepting our requests." Theron's lips faintly curved, his eyes narrowed.

"But with your permission, the King wants us to have trade centres in Zevaria," she said, her eyes down. Arlen's gaze jumped between his father and her. "We wish to expand our trade beyond the eastern cities of Zevaria to the western and the Southern cities like Lord Azekial said."

"But the King has already granted you the route from Eldoria to Elmorne," Julian said, stepping closer. "You can sell your good in those cities along the way as well. And especially in Elmorne, you'll be paid good amounts, they can send your goods to the West."

Elaria knew Julian was not going to let her negotiate easily as he did with Azekial. Even though less experienced than the envoy she still tried to keep her calm. She swallowed, meeting Julian's gaze she answered, "Your Highness, like I said we wish to expand our trade, not limit ourselves to the eastern cities..."

Julian cut her off, "But you aren't trading with the eastern cities alone, you're travelling to a city that is even less than a hundred miles to the Capital.  Julian leant a bit toward her, his eyes narrowing, "What more expansion do you desire?" 

Elaria's tightened her fist, with Julian's eyes catching it. Arlen's brow furrowed, _Let her speak you dumb &&&_ his jaw tightened. Arlen's expressions were noticed by Queen Veyra who had been quiet during the entire conversation, but was active enough to notice.

"Your Highness, " _Shut the &&& up_ she said. "We want to sell our goods to Arania, Assyria," Theron's eyes narrowed. "And Anatole, and we could only do that if we were granted access to the south-western side of Zevaria."

"But you can sail to those lands, without having to ask us for routes," Julian asked, tilting his head.

"Your Highness, you are right. But the southern waters are hostile, and the Nalandian pirates won't let our vessels pass. They take everything and leave none alive," she paused at looked at Theron. "Your Highness, all we ask is your permission to establish trade centres in the Zevaran cities from where we can send our goods to the western cities and those lands." 

Theron's brows furrowed, as words were about to come out, Elaria added, "But, Your Highness, those centres will be under the watch of Zevaran men, appointed by your orders." Her heart raced. 

Arlen swallowed, his heart also galloped as she presented the pledge. He had told her last night how to present her request. Even if she had taken a place in his heart, a part of him wasn't at peace for revealing it to her. Every breath heavy like a rock, his body shivered faintly, but his affection for her got the best of it. He calmed himself and looked for what the King would say.

"And where, do you wish to, establish, these trade centres?" Theron asked, eyes narrow.

"El...,morne Your Highness, we wish to establish one in Elmorne and a couple in the cities along the Red Road," Elaria said, trying to keep calm. She knew a small linger of doubt can make the King decline everything, including Azekial's proposals he accepted earlier.

Theron thought for a few moments, Veyra leant toward him and whispered something in his ear. The envoy and both Elaria and Senara looked at the Queen, and the King nodding to her suggestion. Everyone in the court were thinking what the Queen would have said, including Arlen and his brothers.

Theron looked at Elaria, "Did your father sent you just to ask for this?"

Elaria answered, "No your Highness," she shook her head. "He wanted me to stay here, if..., you allow, and look over the trade centre established here."

Theron looked at Veyra, she gave a subtle nod. He then answered, "You can establish a centre in Elmorne, but only this. Your companion can stay in Elmorne looking over the trade centre." Senara's eyes narrowed. "And as for you, having Zevarian blood and being a noble woman, you'll stay in the palace." Elaria met Senara's gaze. Arlen let out a sigh, a feeling of relief ran through him.

The proposals were accepted by the King, but with a few conditions, not bothering the actual mission. The doubt Queen Veyra had led to both of them separating. Arlen was happy for her staying in the palace close to him but a part of him wasn't quiet satisfied. Well, the pieces were in place on both sides of the chessboard, each ready to strike.
