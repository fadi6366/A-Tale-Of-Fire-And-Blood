# Chapter 16 ( Threads of Fate)

**Merrinvale, Capital of the Azlari Empire**

Water clashed with the mossed base of the City wall. Seagulls flew over the harbour. The sky blue Azlari banners, with the Grey Sea-serpent marked on them hung on the dark walls, flapping in the wind. The city had more than half a dozen towers on the wall facing the sea, and dozens on the landside, guarding the walls that spanned miles. The highest place in the city was the Royal Palace, surrounded by its own walls. 

King Orestane sat alongside a window in his solar, gazing at the city below from the heightened Palace. His arm rested on the window's edge, jaw resting between his fingers, his gaze proud. A knock at the door, followed by the guards call caught his attention.

"Yes?" he said.

"Lord Cassimar is here, Your Highness."

"Let him in," Orestane said.

Hinges creaked as the door swung open. Cassimar walked in, his cloak sweeping the floor. Followed by Kaelen, son of Orestane and the heir to the Azlari throne. A young boy, roughly a couple years older than Arlen.

"You sent for us, Father," Kaelen said, halting a few paces from the King. Cassimar bowed.

Orestane nodded, he picked a parchment from his table. "Azekial sent word." Cassimar's head straightened. "They have been given the trade centres," Orestane said as he stood up. Hands tied behind the back, facing the window he added, "seems like your daughter proved to be as good as you said," he turned toward Cassimar.

Cassimar nodded, "she's been working hard at the Shinobi, your Highness."

"Apparently she got help," Orestane said. Cassimar met Kaelen's gaze, eyes squinting. "The Zevaran heir," Orestane smiled. "The boy spilled it out, how they should plead in front of his father."

Kaelen swallowed, his eyes narrowed. "Father! I don't understand. Why would he help her?"

"It looks like the Prince has fallen in love with our spy." Kaelen's jaw tightened. " Azekial says she told him herself, how he gave her the key the night before they held court," Orestane replied.

The Prince nodded.

Cassimar looked at the disappointed face of Kaelen. The Prince had liked his daughter for years, it was hidden to none. But there were more important matters at hand than the heir's feelings. He looked at Orestane and asked, "Your Highness, anything else they sent to us?"

Orestane nodded, and unfolded the parchment. His eyes traced it as he replied, "It seems their western borders have been compromised. The King has sent the heir to look into the matter."

"Then that gives us a chance to strike," Kaelen said.

"No," Orestane shook his head. "We barely took the islands from them, and that was their navy that failed them. Not the army." Kaelen straightened his neck. "We have just made a peace treaty with them. Sending forces into their lands will bring us only death. The Zevarans might be weak in the waters but not on land."

"That is why, Your Highness," Cassimar looked at Kaelen. "We've sent my daughter there, to gather information about their important cities and routes."

"We'll strike when the time comes," Orestane added. He walked toward Kaelen and placed his hand on his son's shoulder. "But before that," he glanced at Cassimar. "We will the hold the Royal wedding when she returns home."

A rush ran through Kaelen, he looked at Orestane. "Father!"

Orestane gestured with his hand, Kaelen's words stopped in his mouth. "It's time we strengthen our ties with the Aelvans," he looked at Cassimar. The prime advisor nodded. "Let it be no longer a servant house, but a kin to ours."

Kaelen glanced at Cassimar, "But Father will she-"

"She was young to understand then," Orestane cut his words, he met gaze with Cassimar. "I hope she'll be wise enough now to not break her Father's pride."

"Yes, Your Highness, she will," Cassimar nodded.

"But, when will she return home? Father," Kaelen asked.

"As soon as she is done gathering the information we need about them."

Kaelen nodded. 

Orestane gestured Cassimar and the Prime advisor bowed before he left the solar, leaving the Father and Son alone.

Back at Zevaragrad, when the night had cloaked over the horizon. Stars shined like beads and lamps and torches lit up the city. At the Royal Palace in Leyla and Julia's room, sat all the sisters. It was the night before Maria would leave for Dragonsveil. All of them sat on the bed, chatters and chuckles shared.

After they had calmed down, Julia looked at Victoria, "Arlen hasn't written home."

Victoria replied, "the letter we got a couple weeks ago said they had crossed the peaks through Grangnach, after that nothing else."

"Calm down you two," Maria said. "They've ridden far off west, it takes time for word to reach."

"Well, they haven't taken any pigeons with them so," Leyla smirked.

Julia smiled, "you're right, perhaps we're worrying too much."

"He didn't write much anyways, whenever he went away," Victoria added.

"What about Fredrick? Did he sent you any word?" Maria asked.

"It was Fredrick who sent the last letter about the peaks," she answered. A sudden fade on her face.

"You seemed too worried," Julia said. "I mean, they're warriors. Fred is a warrior. He'll be fine, he has been to battles before.

"I don't know, this time it seems different. The west, none of us been there. Whenever Father would take us somewhere it would always be the eastern side or the south," Victoria replied.

"The south was also unknown to them," Julia said. "Yet our brother came back victorious." Victoria nodded.

"I think he should have written, now with that girl Elaria here," Leyla said. Maria's gaze turned toward her.

Julia coughed with her hand covering her mouth.

"Is anything wrong?" Leyla asked.

"No, no," Julia shook her head. "Speaking of Elaria, yes Arlen likes her. We saw them ride home together, the day before he left."

"And he gifted her a sword," Leyla said.

_And told her how to negotiate._ Julia's eyes blinked faintly. "Yes he had it made the day they arrived home from Pinereach."

"Who told you that?" Maria asked.

"His heirness himself," she tilted her head as she replied.

"Seems like Eran's not the only one who keeps secrets for Arlen," Leyla smirked.

"What else did he tell you about her?" Maria asked.

_Promise me. Fine I won't._ The promise she made to him lingered in her head. "Nothing much, just that she's caught his eye the moment he saw her."

Maria looked in Julia's eyes as she straightened back, leaning to the headboard.

"She has Zevarian blood, doesn't that makes us one of us?" Julia asked.

"If that's the case, every person roaming these lands is our relative," Leyla smirked, her arms crossed, holding her knees.

"No, like I mean-"

"I know what you're trying to say," Maria said. "But she didn't grow up here. It doesn't matter what your blood is, you are known by where you grew up."

Julia nodded, for a moment none of them spoke.

"You're leaving tomorrow," Victoria looked at Maria.

"Yes, you have to go back at sometime." Maria replied.

"Why don't you stay longer?" Julia asked, in a childish tone.

"It's been over a month here, Julia. And, not to forget the time it takes to come and go," Maria replied.

"Time flew past like it's a couple day in a week," Leyla said.

"It always passed quick when Maria's home," Julia said.

"Now you'll make my cry," Maria answered with a smile, wiping her eye. And all the sisters embraced her. For a moment she forgot all that was going on in her life. 

The next day, Maria met her family one last time before she entered the carriage. Elaria stood on the steps watching her embrace them all before leaving. She took a light breath, after Arlen the only person she became familiar was Maria. She then went inside, footsteps echoing in the silence.
