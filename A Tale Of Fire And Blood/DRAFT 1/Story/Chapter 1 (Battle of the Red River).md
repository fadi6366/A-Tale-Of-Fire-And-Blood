# Chapter 1 (Battle of the Red River)

**Ironhallow 21st day, 1700 AC (Arkan's Conquest)**

On a cloudy day, mild weather and some sunlight crept through small openings in the dense cloud cover, cold breeze blew over the land. King Theron Zevaran sat on saddle along his son Prince Darius Zevaran III, shouting "Hold the line..." to his men, a forty five-thousand strong host surrounded by the rebels, a host almost twice the size of the imperial force.

With the _Varak River_ on the rear and enemy pushing in from three sides the imperial host seemed it's lines would collapse any second.  Sound of steel clashed into steel, the rebel commander yelled, "Keep pushing, they'll break any second. We will have the king's head."

The imperial soldiers tried their best not to break and keep the shield wall tight, to not allow the enemy to break through. Although through the gaps between the shield wall some spears and swords did manage to come through, piercing the armour of men from both sides as they cried in pain then fell to their demise.

Darius shouting, "Protect the King...", and just as the rebels thought the imperial line was going to break. They heard a thunder of hooves approaching from a distance, horses neighing, men roaring, when some of them turned around to look back they saw figures emerging from a distant ridge, holding imperial banners in their hands.
Dust rose like clouds as fifteen thousand horsemen charged towards the rebels from behind.

At the head of the cavalry rode a young commander, an eighteen year young lad, roaring at the front whirling his sword, face almost red and fire flaming out of his eyes, wearing no helmet and seeming like he would just jump out of his saddle. It was none other than Prince Arlen Zevaran, third son of the King and heir to the Zevaran throne, his bravery stranger to no one.

The rebels didn't expect this at all, with their focus entirely on the King and his forty-five thousand, when they saw horsemen approaching them from behind, they were completely overwhelmed. Even though they outnumbered the sixty thousand Imperial army, this was enough to break the morale. 

One rebel soldier panicking, "Where... where do they came from?" he said to his friend. "There is no way were getting out alive." His friend replied. As they were saying this, Arlen's cavalry closed in on them and on his signal the Imperial cavalry split into two wings taking on the rebel lines from two sides.

Before the rebels could form a shield wall, they curled around the rebel lines and started to push in on them, a clash of steel vs steel. The King ordered his men on the other side of the rebel lines, "Now my men... Push..." and the forty five thousand men which were surrounded before now started to push outwards and into the rebel lines.

Despite being greater in numbers the rebels panicked and after holding the cavalry for a few moments their shield wall that wasn't even properly formed broke and the imperial cavalry pushed in, cutting down hundreds of men by the second. The ones who decided to run couldn't make it out alive.

Arlen's horse lifted the front two legs as he shouted with his sword in air, "For Zevaria.", cutting every horseman or infantry man who dared to come close to him.

Darius on his horse rode through the fighting on the ground cutting down men by his swift swings of the sword. "Leave none alive... take them all out... no one leaves the ground breathing."

A rebel commander fought valiantly cutting down the imperial soldiers, until his horse stopped in front of Arlen's. They both locked gaze for a second. Arlen said, "I've warned you... we won't spare you if you don't call off the rebellion." The commander didn't say anything he shouted and charged towards Arlen. Arlen charged whirling his sword. A couple soldiers watched as the two rode towards each other and within seconds their horses passed one another. 

They swung their swords at one another but just half a moment later, the rebel's head was lying down on the ground while Arlen was intact, untouched by the foe's sword. He stopped his horse and turned around to see the severed head of the enemy commander, Arlen's jaw tightened, as an enemy soldier ran towards him, Arlen swung his blade and sliced through the soldier's chest, his blood splattered on Arlen's horse as he dropped down to the ground.

One by one the enemy soldiers fell, their blood turning the black mud into red, the ones who managed to escape were wounded so badly they couldn't reach home alive, some were even shot dead from behind by the archers.

Many were captured and now were at the mercy of the imperial army and the King himself. The blue waters of the beautiful _Varak River_ were darkened with blood, of those who dared draw sword against the King and now will not live to see their homes or the next dawn again.

***

The smell of blood and dust filled the air as it started to drizzle. Rain drops fell on the corpses of rebel and imperial men who lost their lives during the clash. The rebel banners lied trampled on the ground stained with mud and blood and being walked over the by the imperial horses and men.  The once-green banks of the _Varak River_ now ran red with blood and churned earth. The rebel corpses being dragged and piled up by the Imperial soldiers, and the fallen imperial men prepared for burial.

Prince Darius Zevaran III, eldest son of King Theron, sat in his saddle having a smirk on his face, brows furrowed, his sword dripping fresh blood, eyes cold as he surveyed the field full with fallen men and the wounded crying for help and water.

Commander Nikolai riding his horse, came to a halt beside Darius, "You fought well my prince, the rebels are shown what happens to those who stand against the throne."
Darius smirked, "The ones who rise against us shall always meet their fate." he said as he looked out for any rebel among the corpses still clinching onto his breath. Nikolai nodded in approval.

The younger rebel soldiers, barely older than boys, twisted in the dirt, crying out in pain and agony, pleading, "mercy..., mercy...", some crying out in thirst, "water..., please give us water." an imperial soldier carrying a waterskin came and stood in front of them, taking a sip of water, a menacing smile on his face as he said, "You want water?", the rebels cried with hope, "Yes..., yes..., please...", they pleaded as the soldier spilt the water in front of them and laughed menacingly and walked away.

King Theron, sitting on his saddle, saw all this , no reactions on his face, just a cold stare watching the wounded cry out for mercy and water. At first he didn't react, then with he gave gesture with his fingers. The imperial soldiers grabbed the wounded boys by their hair and took out their daggers. 

The boys cried out loud, "No your Majesty please spare us show us mercy... we'll surrender... we--" blades splashed as their throats were sliced down by the imperial men, putting an end to their cries and life as well, as their bodies trembled as blood splat out before coming to a lifeless halt.

One young rebel soldier, roughly the same as Prince Arlen, who was brought into the field because he was old enough to wield a sword, cried in agony as he crawled to the hooves of Arlen's horse, "Mercy..., Your Majesty Mercy". Arlen, though a seasoned warrior and a commander who just broke the back of a rebel host still carried mercy in his heart, looked at the boy pleading for mercy at his feet, brows furrowed. Seeing that he couldn't do any harm now, neither to him nor the King present in the field. Arlen leaned towards him and said, "Run. Run away, if you wish to live."

The boy gathered his remaining strength, staggering to his feet, turned to flee but had barely limped a few steps before a horse rushed passed him in a flash, the blade sliced through him as he fell lifeless to the ground, with blood splattering across the trampled grass. It was Darius who delivered the final blow to end the boy's life.

Spitting on the corpse, Darius turned his gaze towards Arlen who watched him slice the boy to death. Voice calm but edged with scorn. "You've grown weak," he said as he leaned to wipe the boy's blood off his sword with the corpse "I don't know why father chose you." he said as he straightened.

Arlen's jaw tightened, brow furrowed, eyes looking stared at Darius for a moment before drifted away towards the battlefield where enemy corpses were either lying or being dragged by the Zevarian soldiers. He glanced towards the river now turned red by the blood. The drizzle had now stopped and the sun now slowly showing it's bright face as the cloud now slowly cleared.

Hush fell over the field as King Theron rode closer to where Arlen and Darius were, his royal guard alongside him. His armour covered in dust and blood, sword dripping red, cloak hanging heavy with dust, and his sharp eyes noticing every detail.

He saw Arlen still mounted on his horse, his cloak red with blood and sword still dripping, a slight tiredness on face. Theron came close and dismounted his horse slowly. Arlen and Darius followed, and stood before their father.

Theron with a proud smile on his face, put his hand on Arlen's shoulder, "You fought well, my son. Well done," Theron said as Arlen gave him a smile back, "Your plan broke their back, even they were larger in numbers, you've outplayed them with your surprise and the Dragon's split." Theron praised him loud enough for the soldiers nearby to hear.

Arlen bowed his head after Theron took his hand gently of Arlen's shoulder. ""Thank you, Father".

Beside him, Darius watched in silence, hatred burning in his chest ,as if he was watching his father praise not his own brother but someone else who didn't belong to the family. His jaw tightened with bitterness; his hand clenched around his sword hilt.

Theron turned around and looked at the field of corpses. "Burn the rebels' bodies by evening," he ordered coldly and loudly. "And bring me the heads of the ones leading the host. The realm must see our victory." Lowering his voice slightly, "and bury the ones we lost."

Graves were dug for the eight thousand imperial men who lost their lives that day and were buried. Over seventy thousand rebel corpses were piled up, and set to flame that evening, smoke rising up high in the air and ash drifting over the red Varak as if dark snow fell from the sky.

Before mounting his horse again, Arlen cast a final look at the corpse of the rebel boy who came crawling to his feet. He felt something familiar to pain in his heart, his brow furrowed as disappointment carved deep into his face." At least those who pleaded should've been left to live," he said to himself, voice low enough so no one except himself could hear it.

He then turned away, silently closing his eyes for half a moment and opened them while mounting his horse and rode to join his father on the way back home, the roar of the once blue river now turned red, behind him, and smoke from the burnt corpses rising into the sky. 

***

**A day later...**

Cold breeze blew across, as the setting sun peeked through the cloud cover. Evening shadows spilled across the high windows of the solar, painting the cold stone walls in gold and grey. Candles flickering among ledgers, scrolls, and troop maps scattered across the table, the edges curling as candlewax dripped on the polished wood. A pair of quills lay across the rim of a heavy black inkwell.

By the window, in the light of the dusk, Queen Veyra Zevaran stood gazing toward the courtyard hope and fear present in her eyes at the same time. Heart racing as the time passed. Her fingers laced before her, gaze switching between the entrance of the courtyard and the sky above.

_When will they return?, are they safe?, will they return?_ her mind kept repeating as time passed.
She silently murmured prayers, "Oh God! Please bring them back safe." Not a Queen but a mother praying for her sons especially the younger one, Arlen to return safely. Anxious and hopeful at the same time. Waiting for word from the Varak.

Across the solar, Julian Zevaran, the second son of King Theron, sat cloaked, his head bent, gaze on the table, eyes scanning the scrolls, quill in hand, writing and pausing moment by moment as he carefully made notes in the margins, humming as he was making up through the things he studied, finger on the points he read, and sometime leaning his head, he glanced on his mother standing by the window in worry and praying for their safe return ,"Any time now... It's been days since they've left for the fight against the rebels". He said to himself as his gaze flickered now and then toward the door, listening for footsteps that might bring news from the field.

As he dipped a quill in the inkwell to add something more in the notes he was making he heard a knock on the door, his hand stopped with the quill just above the parchment as he was about to write. Queen Veyra's gaze shifted from the outside towards the door.

Julian without lifting his gaze, continued writing as he answered, "Yes...?"

The doors opened, creaking as they moved away from each other, and a guard stepped in, spear in hand, resting it on the ground, bowing his head as he said, "Your Majesty, the pigeon master wants to speak to you."

Queen Veyra's eyes widened a bit, her hand on her chest, her heart raced as her the soft line of her mouth tensed in worry, her gaze locked onto the guard.

Julian stopped writing, he put the quill down on the table beside the parchment, as he was about to speak.

"Send him in," the Queen said, in a worrying voice. Julian looked at his mother for a moment then set his gaze back at the door.

The guard bowed, lifted his spear and turned around to walk back. A moment later, the pigeon master entered, cloak dusty, heart racing after sprinting to the solar from the pigeon house, catching his breath slowly as he stood.

Julian gazed at him, shook his head a bit, and gestured with hand as if saying yes? what is it?

The pigeon master bowed, "Your Majesty... Word from the Varak."

Julian's eyes sharpened, as the master said those words.

The Queen's breath caught in her throat. She looked up, "God! Please be good news." before looking back at the pigeon master, gaze sharpened; hope and dread sparking in her eyes. Her voice, tight with urgency, cut through the silence of the chamber. "Well? Speak, what news from the field?" She stepped a few paces forward. Brows furrowed, jaw tightened, heart anxious what would have happened. "Are they okay? Did they win? Is Arlen okay?" as if her mind was speaking to her.

The keeper slightly right and raised his head just enough to meet the Queen's gaze. With a slight smile of relief on his face, "My Queen," he said, still catching his breath, "The rebels were crushed. Prince Arlen led the decisive cavalry charge and broke their back. Both the princes and the King is unharmed and returning home, they will arrive soon, You Majesty."

Relief swept across the Queen's face, she looked up, this time not worried but grateful, "Thank God!", s sigh of relief, before her gaze turned back to the pigeon master, ,"Thank God! they're okay. Thank God! my sons are safe." No pride of triumph or victory in her words, only relief, happiness and a quiet desperation.

Julian's gaze kept fixed on the pigeon master, he tilted his head a bit, brows furrowed, "What about the men who fell? How many rebels fell? How many did we loose?" He asked.

The keeper turned to face Julian and raised his head to meet his gaze. "Over seventy thousand rebels, my prince, they were killed and then our King ordered to burn the corpses," he swallowed then continued, "those who ran weren't in the state to survive long, many died on the way back, and eight thousand of our men fell in battle, the King ordered to bury them there," he paused for a moment before adding, "and... the King himself praised Prince Arlen before everyone for leading the surprise attack and breaking the back of the enemy."

Julian's jaw tightened, he closed his eyes for a moment, let out a breath then opened them again to meet the master's gaze, forcing his expression to remain calm. "That will be all," he said, gestured with his hand to the master to leave.

The master bowed to the prince and the Queen, she nodded, he backed away and the guards closed the door softly behind him as he stepped back facing Julian.

Queen Veyra went back to stand beside the window, this time not in anxiety or worry, but with relief and happiness.

Julian's lips tightened, his eyes fixed on the map, the part showing the Varak, he glanced it for a moment then turned his eyes to notes he was making earlier. 

Then with a low voice in an envious tone, "Father's praise always comes easily when blood is fresh on the ground... it has always come easily for him, even the little things he does, he always sees Arlen. Even for small things he gets praised."

Queen Veyra watched as words poured out from Julian's mouth, her face caught between an expression of sorrow and quiet disappointment, her brows furrowed. Her eyes locked on his face, searching it, not in anger but as though looking for something she couldn't find or see.

She stepped closer, the faint rustle of her gown breaking the silence in the room.

"Your brother crushed a rebellion, Julian. That's no small thing." Julian rolled his eyes, the Queen continued "It was never the question of blood my son," she added softly, "Your father's heart is drawn to steel and battle cries... Yes. But that does not mean it beats only for the son who wields them." She put rested her hand on his shoulder, "You are all his sons, Julian and loves you all equally."

Julian let a breath pass through, he looked at her, "That's why he named him the heir, when he was just seventeen. While me and Darius were present, much older and much more knowing of the world."

The Queen took her hand off his shoulder," Maybe your father saw something in him that wasn't in you two.", she turned and started to walk toward the door, for one last time she turned toward him and this time a bit more softer, "You were never Arlen... you were never meant to be." and walked away.

Julian looked at her as she left the solar, his jaw tight, shoulders stiffened, he gaze turned to the parchment, his first tightened, before he took a breath and picked up the quill to keep writing.

***

The evening sunlight broke through the gaps between the trees, spitting gold and grey on the dirt road. Horse hooves echoed through the silence, as the imperial column rode with King Theron leading them. Arlen rode alongside his father, the scenes of the battle still flashing in mind, the boy Darius killed in front him after he told him to run, his cries of mercy, mercy still echoing in Arlen's mind. 

None of them spoke for a while. They just rode silently as the sun was slowly touching the horizon. Theron, with his cold, rigid gaze still ahead on the road, one hand tightly gripping the rein of his horse and the other resting on his lap, breaking the silence he said, "Your plan of surprising the enemy from behind worked, perfectly."

As Arlen snapped out of the flashes of the battle, "You broke their backs entirely, even though they were more than us in numbers." Theron paused, half a smile on his face, "Your grandfather would have ordered to write songs about it."

Arlen smiled as he glanced at his father, "well he loved songs didn't he, Father". Theron nodded with his gaze locked ahead, mouth widening to reveal his teeth slightly for a smile, "Call it a hobby, he used to write and sing all day when he had nothing else to do." 

Arlen turned his gaze ahead keeping the smile, lifting one of his brows he said, "I remember his voice, he used to gather us all near the creek and sing, what a lovely tone... he had" for a moment his gaze turning back to Theron as he said those words. 

Theron nodded with a smile, "The king with the voice of a nightingale, they called him." The prince's face lit with up with a smile for a moment.

As his smile faded he turned his gaze down, "But the men, Father..." he paused, "They also fought bravely, against a host having more numbers," he turned his head up and looked at Theron as they rode ahead, "They deserve the praise as well, since many of them laid down their lives".

Theron nodded in approval, turned his eyes towards Arlen, " Numbers and men become useless if the one leading them fumbles at making the right move at the right time, blood becomes useless if they ride blindly into a fight," Theron turned his face ahead, "That's why my son..., in battles the ones commanding the force are rewarded and respected, the ones who follow the word..." Theron caught his breath, raised a brow, " Bounty waits them."

Arlen said nothing, as his silence approved the king's words. They went silent for half a mile. Letting the fresh air in, Arlen's gaze switching constantly between the road ahead, and eye-pleasing sight of the setting sun, "God! it's beautiful", Arlen's mind whispered. 

His brows furrowed as if something clicked in his head, he turned his gaze around then behind, searching for his brother, Darius. Arlen saw nothing but men and commanders in their cloaks and armours, some on horse, some on foot, sword or spear in their grasp. He noticed the column was less in numbers from the total of what left the field to return back. He turned his gaze toward the king, "Father..., I don't see Darius, didn't he left the field along side us?" he asked in a curious tone.

Theron sharpened his eyes, but kept them forward on the road, his tone cold and deep, "Your brother rides South to finish up what remains of the rebels," his gaze turned towards the setting sun for a moment, "the towns, cities and the villages they emerged from." words poured from his mouth as he looked ahead.

Arlen gaze turned into a glare, his grip on the rein tightened, he didn't approve of this move made by his father. He turned towards Theron, trying to keep his tone calm, "But father, that means he'll slaughter women and innocent children, and what about the infants and those who are yet to open their eyes to this world." he swallowed as he finished.

Theron's face didn't show much emotion, his expression cold, voice deep, his shoulders stiffened as he said, "Rebels are rebels my son, even the children carry blood of ones who stood against us, if not today then perhaps tomorrow they will rise the ones who fell today in battle." he continued without pausing, "We might forget tomorrow but..., Blood remembers."

Arlen face showed clear signs of irritation after hearing Theron's answer, his eyes shut for a moment as his face turned ahead, let a breath through, "But Father, it doesn't mean we slaughter the new born in their cradle and the unborn in the womb..." he paused, and turned his eyes ahead as if his words were useless in front of the king who already had made his decision. He took a breath, shook his head slightly in disapproval, as they silently rode ahead. 

The column behind them moved along, horses hooves splashing the mud and water from the paddles they stepped on. A soldier walking along felt a bit tired and slowed down, his friend on horse passed beside him saying, "Move it you sloth...",a teasing tone. He smiled back at him and continued to walk ahead. A couple of them lifting the waterskins to drink water as they rode their horses. Commander Nikolai calling out the men who slowed down a bit, "Come on, move..., move...," urging them to hurry up to reach the Capital as quick as they can.

A few miles behind them down south, corpses of men cut down laid on the ground, cries of children and women filled the air, the ground red with blood, as imperial men along with Darius rode through the area. "Cut all of them down, leave none alive, let them be an example of what happens to those who rise against the Zevaran throne."

A young boy hiding behind a cart saw all this,  his arm around the younger one as he cried. A soldier glanced at them and approached, before they could run the man swung his sword and the boy fell on the ground, lifeless, blood spilled out from the cut made by the blade, the younger one stood near and before he shed more than a couple tears, the blade pierced his back and came out from where his heart was. When the man took it out, the little one's cries stopped but this time permanently as he also fell to the ground near his brother's fresh corpse.

That day over a thirty thousand, men, women, children were cut down. The entire Kantari tribe was butchered like sheep, Darius and his men's blade whirled and swung through anyone they saw breathing as they rode. Town after town, Village after village was cleansed of human life, the ruling family of Kantari and the people who lived under them now faced the same fate, the fate of traitors. 

After the massacre Darius visited those tribes who stood by the Kantari in the rebellion, he brought the severed heads of the Kantari lord and his family, threw them in front of the ally lords, with the same message to everyone, "They rose against us and met their fate, you stood by their side, as a warning I bring you the heads of their lords' heads. Think of repeating the same mistake and you'll end up even worse..."

The lords bent their knees against the imperial men and the prince, their soldiers already fallen at the battle of the Varak now referred to as The Red River because of it's blue waters turning red by the blood of the fallen men. Those who refused to obey were cut down by Darius and his men. Word of the massacre spread across the lands, spreading fear among those who dare think of rising against the king.

The Kantari were completely wiped off the face of the world, as if they never were even there. The towns once full of life now became a pool of blood and corpse with nothing but vultures and wild animals feeding on the remains of the ones butchered.
