# Chapter 15 (A Trail into Shadows)

**A Couple Days Later, 3rd Snowtide 1701 AC**


Eran loosened the arrow and it hissed through the air, striking the target just half an inch from the centre. He let out a small breath and picked another one, for a moment he looked at it's tip. He then turned his eye at the target, and nocked it again. He held it for a couple moments and then loosened it. It struck at the centre this time. His lip curved.

"You know, if you take that much time during a fight, you won't get a chance to nock another one." Eran turned to see, it was Torren, wearing his scholar drapes, and strap of his bag wrapped around his torso. He smiled as he walked toward Eran.

Eran placed his bow on the table, letting out a breath. He smiled, looking at Torren's bad he said, "You've decided to leave as well," in a low voice. 

Torren looked at his bag and nodded, "Father's decided I should go now," he looked at Eran. "Can't learn everything, staying home."

Eran nodded, lips tightened. "How long will you stay there?"

Torren shrugged, lips tight. "I don't know," he raised his brows. "Maybe a couple years..., or more."

"Arlen has gone to another fight, Maria's only here for some time, and..., Julia likes to be by herself when she's practicing her swords, and you know the others." Eran replied. Torren nodded, lowering his gaze. " And now, you're going as well."

Torren put his hand at Eran's shoulder, politely pulling him close. "Arlen won't be gone for long, and Julia..., yes she can be, weird sometimes. You'll still have Mother and Victoria to talk to," Torren smiled before he said, "And, you can always bother Leyla."

Eran nodded, swallowing as his eyes wettened. Torren pulled him into an embrace. Eran wrapped his arms around his brother. A warmth felt by both of them in the cold of Snowtide. Eran closed his eyes as his chin rested on Torren's shoulder.

Julian strode across the gallery at the upper floor, cloak swinging. His gaze caught the sight of the embrace between his younger brothers. His eyes softened, jaw tightened as he swallowed. Something lingered inside his chest. Torren's eyes met his before letting go of the embrace. Julian broke gaze before he strode ahead, shoes echoing in silence.

Eran curved the corner of his lip, "Be sure to come by when you have time. I won't like seeing you forget your way home."

Torren smirked, "Don't worry," he blinked one of his eyes, "I'll do pay a visit once  a few months."

Eran nodded, both of them shook hands, one last time. Torren walked off toward the courtyard. Eran watched him as the echo of his shoes faded. He then looked at his bow and arrows, "Well, it's just you and me now."

He picked up his bow and started his archery again. The sound of the arrows loosening and hitting the target echoed in the quiet of the inner yard. Torren now had departed to the City of Scrolls, the centre of Knowledge in Zevaria and perhaps this side of the world.

**Five Weeks Later on the Road West, 8th Bloomrise 1701 AC.**

**A Few Dozen Miles from Greywatch**

The surroundings had turned lush green as Spring had arrived, flowers were blooming. The day would start to get a bit hot but the cooler winds still ruled the lands at till noon. It had rained as well the previous night, so the clouds were still there, enough to let the sun through.

Arlen rode on his horse, Fredrick alongside him with the Zevaran column behind them. It had been a tiring month on the road. The destination was just a day of riding ahead. Hooves splattered the water in the marshes as the horse strode along. Arlen looked around the fields, beautiful, lush green. He face lit up seeing the beauty of these lands. He had never crossed the Black Peaks to the west before. 

"They should have built the Capital here," Fredrick said. "These lands are more beautiful than we've been told."

Arlen smiled, looking around. "You're right." His smile faded after something lingered in his mind, "But being beautiful didn't save them from the enemy." Arlen let out a sigh, "They might be beautiful, but the danger is still there."

Fredrick smirked before he answered, "And why do you think we've been sent here? To get rid of the danger," he turned his gaze ahead. "Don't worry, you'll get the chance of building one here, once you're King."

Arlen grinned, "Perhaps the Lord of the Valdreks might also think of migrating here, well when he becomes Lord."

Fredrick let out a subtle laugh. "It would be good, won't it. Your Capital and our manor just a day apart or even less. At least we won't have to wait for months or for a war to see each other."

Arlen nodded, "You're right." His lips widening enough to reveal his teeth. They strode ahead, for a few moments neither spoke.

Fredrick then broke the silence, "That girl at the Starlit Refuge, she seemed quite into you."

"She was just serving wine, and I don't drink," Arlen answered.

"I mean she looked like she wouldn't have minded a Prince's attention. Unless his attention is already somewhere else."

Arlen met Fred's gaze, "You seemed quite intrigued by her, why didn't you make a move."

"Your sister would kill me if I did that," Fred answered.

Arlen chuckled, "Well she keeps you in check then, At least."

Fred nodded, "And, what about that girl you met at our house? You two got along well."

Arlen nodded, "Yes, she's good. But-"

"But she's from an enemy court," Fred cut Arlen off.

"Yes, yes she is. And that puts everyone in my family on toes. The day we first met, my sister Maria warned me to be careful."

"Were you?"

"What?"

"We're you careful?"

Arlen's brows furrowed, he swallowed before answering, "Well, the night before the court. I told her what to say so that my Father accepts their treaty."

Fred nodded slowly, though his smile fainted. "So, you let them in, in simple words."

"Yes."

"You followed your heart."

"I did, but something didn't seem right."

"You messed up, yes. Because you felt for her. If she does the same," Fred turned his gaze ahead. "I'm sure it will be enough to stop her from doing anything that would harm you."

Arlen nodded, he didn't say anything. _I hope we're wrong. I hope I didn't make a mistake letting them in._ Both of them rode ahead in silence. Arlen's fingers grabbed his locket, a crescent shaped pendent. His eyes lowered, gazing at it, the surroundings seemed to blur for the moments he stared it.

The cool wind brushed his hair against his face, he let his grip go and it hung on his neck. Arlen turned his gaze ahead, riding silently ahead. The travel was now almost over and the mission was set to begin.

***

Thunder echoed as the clouds had started to thicken. Horse hooves splattered in the mud as they rode down. Arlen's eye caught a town just ahead, but no movement to be seen. _Something's wrong._ He narrowed his gaze and then jerked his arms, snapping the rein. His horse took faster steps as he approached the entrance, followed by Fredrick and Bryndan, a soldier.

He lifted his gaze at the arch, it was broken from the centre. Arlen's horse slowly stepped ahead, looking at town.  The huts had been burnt, most of them completely to the ground. The path covered in mud and blood. His brows furrowed, heart raced as he witnessed the ruins. 

"This seems fresh," Fred remarked from behind.

Arlen turned towards Fred, "Fresh?"

"It looks like it happened last night," Fred replied. He pulled the reins and dismounted his horse. His shoes splattering the mud. He handed the rein to the soldier walking beside. 

Almost half the column had now dismounted their horses, looking around the ruins, shocked to see what had been done to those people. 

Arlen's eyes widened, chills ran down his spine as he saw something more sinister at the centre of the town. Corpses piled up on each other, surrounded by a circle made by their blood. His took slow breaths, his eyes teared up. _It looks like-_

The sound of coughs came from distance. A young boy struggling. They rushed toward him, Arlen placing his hand underneath him and lifting his head. 

"Medic..., medic, where is he?" Fred shouted.

The medic rushed toward them, he quickly rubbed stones to start a fire. Arlen took a cloth and pressed it on the boy's hip, his hand got red from the blood coming out.

"Stay with me," Arlen said. Gripping his hand tight.

The boy tried to speak, but he didn't have the strength. Arlen grabbed his hand tightly.

"Look at me," he cried, the boy's eyes fainting.

"Hurry up," Fred cried, looking at the Medic.

"It'll take a moment, My Lord," the Medic replied, heating the dagger in the fire. 

"Give that to me," Fred said, grabbing the medicine from him. He took a bandage, and poured the medicine on it. "You heat it up, we'll clean the wounds." The medic nodded.

Arlen looked at the boy, "Please," his heart raced, tears piling up.

"Get it done, QUICK," Fred shouted. He gestured him to take the cloth off and started to clean the wound. The boy struggled in pain as Fred cleaned it. 

"Please," Arlen's heart beat seemed to slow as the boy's hands got cold. He had stopped coughing and struggling in pain. His eyes froze, gazing at Arlen. His soul had left his body.

Arlen closed his eyes, tears ran down his cheek, he placed his head on the boy's chest. 

Fred looked at Arlen, his jaw tightened. Fred stood up and said, "Look around for survivors, they're might be still clinging to life."

A huge thunder rumbled, followed by a drizzle. Cold drops fell on Arlen's neck, he looked up. The drizzle slowly had started to pick up pace. He let go of the boy's hand. 

The soldiers kept searching around, but no one had survived. 

Bryndan walked toward Fredrick. "No survivors, My Lord."

Arlen closed his eyes, rainwater fell on his face. He tightened his fist, letting out a breath. 

***


Horse let out a polite neigh as it strode down the path. The tree-leaves rattled in the wind, rain falling on them. Rodion rode at front, with Talon by his side. They had left Grimwood a few days ago. Greywatch was a day's ride ahead. 

"Seems like his Highness' plan worked, Commander," Talon said.

Rodion nodded, "Indeed, but we should also be grateful to that soldier from the Varangian."

"Yes, these routes proved to be safe," Talon replied.

The saddles clanged, hooves splattering the water. The soldiers squinted their eyes from the rain. 

"Have you even been here? Commander," Talon asked.

Rodion shook his head, "The farthest I've been to the West is Grangnach." Talon's lip curved, his eyes narrowed. "Before we rode for the war South, I was sent to gather men."

"It's a beautiful city," Talon said.

"It is indeed," Rodion smiled. "Lying between those mountains, once you ride up there, you don't want to come back down."

Talon nodded, "My Father was from Grangnach, he was a merchant there."

Rodion said, "Oh, that's great. You should have introduced at least when we passed through there."

"He was not there on that day. He was outside the city."

Rodion nodded, a small curve at his lip. 

A few moments later Rodion's eyes widened, he heard a bowstring twang from a distance. He was about the pull the rein, an arrow hissed through the air and struck Talon. Piercing through his throat. Talon's choked and fell of his horse. 

Rodion shouted, "AMBUSH!"

Before the soldiers could react, more arrows flew through the air, now from the opposite side. Striking men at their throats, some at their chests. In a matter of moments, dozens of soldiers fell of their mounts. 

Rodion dismounted his horse and took his shield. "Form a shield wall," he cried. They heard loud shrieks and cries as riders appeared from both sides of the muddy path. They weren't holding reins, instead loosening arrows as they circled around the column. The Zevaran soldiers who took out shields their in time survived that wave, while those who couldn't now lay lifeless in the mud. The horses panicked and started to neigh loud, running off the path, stampering the ones who died below their hooves.

Rodion's stomach churned. Heart racing, _How can this be?_

After the riders cleared, "LOOSE," a shout came from behind the bushes. More arrows came raining down on them, one struck Rodion at his shoulder. He immediately snapped it in half. 

The smoke riders cried out loud as they emerged from the bushes, waving their swords. The Zevaran column formed the shield wall. Rodion was shocked to see, a smoke rider sat down just ahead of the shield wall, another came running in, jumping over him and striking a soldier in his eyes, his shield fell. A couple more were taken down by them.

They held the wall for a while, but Rodion knew they couldn't hold it forever. The smoke riders just kept coming. _This is it then._ Rodion looked at one of the soldiers and gave a nod. They pushed their shields outwards, on both sides. 

Rodion cried, "Don't die before killing a dozen of em'." Lifting his sword. He struggled from the arrow pierced in his shoulder. A smoke rider covered in black rushed toward Rodion, his sword high up, he jumped at took a strike. Rodion blocked it, and after a couple exchanges of blows he took down the rider.

The Zevaran men fought hard, in a brutal arm to arm. But it was not long before the horse riders returned. They took down every Zevaran man who stood in their way. 

Rodion stood firm, looking at one riding toward him. Just as he came close, a blow on Rodion's back made him fall to the ground. A rider had struck him from behind. 

It was not long until the entire column fell, lying dead in the mud. Rodion looked at Talon's dead body and gathered his strength to stand, but he was kicked back by the smoke rider. He looked into his eyes, his face covered in black, hate burning in his eyes. 

The rider knelt and brought his sword toward Rodion's throat. Rodion pierced a dagger into his hip. The rider cried in pain, and threw a couple blows right at Rodion's face. Struggling from the blow he put his sword at Rodion's throat. Without wasting a single moment, he sliced it.

Rodion's mouth filled up with blood, splattering it out. The world started to fade out, eventually blacking out. His body struggled for a moment before coming to a pause. He lay dead on the ground, eyes open toward the sky.

The entire column was wiped out by the Smoke Riders. The dark mud and the puddles now completely red from blood. Five hundred Zevaran men lay dead, right in the middle of the road. The Smoke riders didn't stand to look at how many they cut down. They mounted their horses and the ones on foot, disappeared in the bushes as soon as the last Zevaran soldier fell to the ground. Rain falling on the corpses.

***

Rain drops fell on Arlen's cheeks. He took a breath as his eyes opened. He looked at the boy's corpse in front of him. He swallowed. 

Mud splashed and leaves crackled under Bryndan's shoes as he walked toward Fredrick. He met his gaze, curling his lips he shook his head. Fredrick gave a silent nod, sighing. 

Bryndan looked at Arlen, "Maybe we should-"

An arrow hit Bryndan on his shoulder, his sword fell to the ground.

Figures emerged from the bushes, blades splashing. The Zevaran men went down, dragged from their saddles, sliced down where they stood.

An arrow slammed into Arlen's chest.

Another one hit Fredrick in the leg and he fell to the ground.

Riders poured through the arch, cutting down Zevarian men who swung at them. Arrows rained from the bushes, shooting down the ones mounted.

As Arlen snapped the arrow, a rider's sword struck him and he fell. He grabbed his sword and lifted himself up. Another rider rushing toward him, Arlen swung his sword and both their blades clashed. The rider staggered, another man one ran toward him. Arlen swung his blade, taking him down, taking quick breaths.

Bryndan struggled as he picked up his sword. As he snapped the arrow a couple men covered in black rushed toward him. Bryndan blocked the first one's blow, but second one was quick enough to break through and struck him at his hip.

Fredrick gathered his strength, and stood up. He looked at Arlen blocking the blows from the masked men. Another one was rushing at Arlen from behind, Fredrick cried as he ran toward them and blocked his blow. Arlen pushed them back, another rider slammed his blade at his back. The Prince fell to the ground.

Fredrick's eyes widened, he shouted. A blade pierced through his back, cutting itself out from his chest. The taste of crimson filled his mouth, as the blade sliced itself out. Blood ran down from his jaws, he spit it out as he fell to the ground.

Arlen's gaze fainted as he saw him fall in front of him. His heart raced, breath felt heavy as he stared at him.

Bryndan's hip spat out blood as he fell in the mud. His eyes gazed at the raining sky, as a figure appeared, holding a blade. He swung it, slicing through Bryndan's throat. Bryndan choked as he spat out blood, his hand on the wound before it fell lifeless.

The man leading the raiders sat at his dark horse. His face covered in black. A scar on his eye brow. He looked at the field and the corpses of the fallen Zevaran men. "Send word to our friend from the Capital," he looked at a rider beside him. "We're grateful for his assist."

The rider nodded, before he turned his horse away. The drizzle had now picked up the pace. Water fell on the corpses of the fallen men. After the last man fell, the leader signalled them all to leave the town. 

A rider shouted, "Let's go!" and the ones on foot, rushed toward the trees and the bushes. Riders mounted their horses, trampeling the fallen soldiers below their mounts' feet. The raiders who were taken down in the battle were dragged by them on to their horses. In a matter of moments they had emptied the town.

All left was complete silence. The only sound was the rain falling on them. 

Arlen's brows squinted, as he opened his eyes, lying on his chest. He looked at Fredrick who laid lifeless. Arlen coughed, struggling as he dragged himself toward his friend. 

"No," he coughed. "No!" he then fainted. He fell to the ground just beside Fredrick, his arm on Fred's chest. Both brothers in arms now laid on the ground, rain falling on them.

Miles away from the town where the Prince fell, after the rain had stopped. The figure strode through the woods, gaze on the leaves covered in water. Hand on the damp trunk of the trees. A curve on their face. 

A strange feeling ran through their chest. The figure's violet eyes turned toward where the town was. 

"On zdes'," the figure said, brows raised. _He's here._
