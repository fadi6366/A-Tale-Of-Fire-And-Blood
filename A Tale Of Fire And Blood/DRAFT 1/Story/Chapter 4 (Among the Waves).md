# Chapter 4 (Among the Waves)

**Crimson Sea..., 33th Ironhallow 1700 AC.**

The wooden deck of the ship creaked as it sailed , sails pushed by the wind to move the vessel ahead through the calm, sea waters. Scent of sea salt everywhere. White covering some parts of the ship. The younger crew members threw bait in the wates to catch some fish, some succeeded some failed.

"Woow, I caught a big one this time."

"Mine returned empty this time as well."

"Let's take em' inside, we need food for the night."

The Captain stood with his crewmate on the main deck navigating, map in his hand. He nodded and gestured them to take their catch inside.

"The Centaki Island is just ahead Capt'n."

A crewman's shout from below deck got carried by the wind.

"Yes, we should reach there by tomorrow mornin'."

As the wind slowed down, the captain ordered to drop the sails and the rowing team to take position. "Come on move it ya' slow a'sses."

The rowing team descended below deck, the massive oars, dipped into the waters as the being to row. The crewman shouted, PORT..., as they steered to port side.

Elaria stood on the upper deck, her arms crossed, eyes tired from the voyage, cloak damp from the rainstorm last night. She let out a sigh, mist emerged from her mouth, shiver ran across her body due to the cold, as she gazed at the horizon, endless water on every side, her gaze turned to, before it got locked to the island emerging ahead in the distance, but it was still a night away.

Senara walked toward her, chewing on cashews she brought along, she offered some to Elaria as she halted beside her, "Here..., you've eating nothing since last night."

Elaria took them and threw some in her mouth, she swallowed before she said, "The storm last night..., I didn't feel like eating after that."

"Yes..., the waves were hostile, I was assure we've seen the last of each other."

Elaria smiled, "Guess we aren't gonna get rid of each other this easily," her gaze ahead at the horizon. Both of them giggled.

"Nope guess we're not."

"The boys caught a big one today, dinner will be delicious tonight," Senara leaned toward her, gaze down toward the boys taking the catch inside.

Elaria said nothing, she smiled as she took a look down at the deck before gazing back at the horizon.

Senara, after a couple moments of silence, "You're thinking about the mission, right?"

Elaria, took a sigh, she swallowed before she said, " Once we land on the island..., we'll be in their territory, I wonder... what it feels like, to be in a foreign place."

"Well you won't have to wonder for long, we'll soon be there."

Elaria nodded, "You know, every since we've left Bayside Landing, every time I look at the west..., it reminds me of my mother," her voice showing the pain of growing up without her mother.

Senara's smile faded as she noticed Elaria's tone, she put her hand on Elaria's arm, "She was a good woman," her voice low.

"She died when I was three, I barely remember anything about her, just this...," her fingers rubbed against the cold metal of the locket she was wearing, a gold pendent, etched with a sunburst design, it's narrow rays spreading outwards.

The captain shouted to hoist the sails, as the cold wind started to blow.

Senara looked at the locket, "This belonged to her, didn't it?"

Elaria with her eyes closed for a moment, gave a nod, "All I know is she used to wear it all the time," Elaria looked at Senara as she spoke, "I found this in old box, in my father's chamber, I was ten," she paused, "He told me it was my mother's."

"So what happened to her?"

Elaria turned her gaze toward the horizon again, "I... don't know, really, I..., some say she was poisoned, others say she became sick and died."

"What do you think?"

"I'm not sure...," her eyes almost filled up as she resisted it as she swallowed it down.

"I'm sure she's in a better places," Senara comforted her, as she wrapped her arm around Elaria's shoulder, she felt it's warmth as the cold wind blew.

"Yes..., she sure is..." 

The ship kept on sailing, the wooden structure creaked as the crew and other passengers roamed around. The envoy sat down on a chair, enjoying the view of the outside as he started to feed on the fish stew prepared for breakfast.

**The next day...**


"PORT," the captain shouted, commanding to steer the ship toward the Island now closing up, 
the crewmen rowed hard to turn the ship left toward the destination, the wooden body of the vessel creaked as it moved toward the harbour.

"C'mon row faster, we ain' got all day," the captain's second in command shouted, standing in the below deck as the crew used all their strength to move the ship toward the Island. 

Elaria stood on front deck, _So..., the first Zevarian lands. Let's see what this side of the world has in store._ 

"It's been some sail Capt'n, took us twelve days, if wasn't for those storms, we would've arraived in four days maybe, or three." the crewman spoke to the captain, as the ship slowed down before docking.

"Aye, they really did slow us down," the captain replied, turning toward the boys deployed on anchor duty, he then shouted, "LOWER THE ANCHOR."

The boys held the levers as they ran in circle to push them, the anchor slowly lowered down, metal chained clanking as it un rolled, the crewman blowed in the trumpet and the sound horn was heard across the harbour as the ship slowed down and halted, the anchor touched down the surface, many feet below the water.

"Y'all have till tomorrow dawn, eat, sleep, roam around, rest well, tomorrow we leave for Dragonweil, we have a long journey ahead," the captain spoke to the passengers on board before they left the deck.

Elaria and Senara took the small money bags they had with them, gold enough for a three day trip. They left the rest of their stuff in their cabin as they would return back for departure in the morning.

"So, we're here," Senara in an excited tone, eager to explore the new land they've stepped on.

"This is not the place we intend to be, we've stopped only for a day, don't get too glad," Elaria said as they both walked off the ship.

Metal cups clanged as a drunk group of friends cheered before chugging down the Red Vale. "And then, I' punched em in his sourry face, WHO'S THE LEADER OF THE HERD NOW, I' said", one of them spoke in a drunk and half conscious tone, didn't have the fully idea of what he spoke, telling the others about a past story and they all laughed.

"Yeah you really screwed him bad, fella, that's what real men are a'bout," the other one answered before they all cheered again, clanking the cups together and filling the inn hall with their laughter.

Elaria and Senara watching all this after they'd entered the inn looked at each other, raising their brows and squinting their lips, their faces showing clear disgust from the scene before they gave each other a small giggle.

They found an empty table near the counter and took their seats. Both letting out a sigh, after days of travel in the sea, they finally got to solid ground, even though temporarily but that still mattered.

The waitron approached as the two of them took breath, a piece of cloth wrapped on his head, his apron stained, "I see two fine young ladies, what can I serve you? Vine, we have the finest, in the eastern shores of Dawngard, our Red Vale needs no introduction," he bragged, hands folded.

Both of them shared a glance, Elaria then gesturing with her hand, "Umm... Do you have something else than vine?", Senara looked at Elaria, gesturing why she'd ask something else than vine. Elaria squinted her eyes as well.

The waitron's face a little less excited after hearing she doesn't want the Vale, "Well, we have the famous honey-ice water, coconut water...," he answered before being interrupted by Senara.

"What's there to eat?" Elaria hit her hand politely against her head.

"Um... My lady," he nodded as looked at Senara, "We have our famous crab-stew, roasted salmon, and if you don't want sea-food we have our famous roasted deer, goat-meat, and gray francolin."

As Senara was about to speak, Elaria, raised her head, "We'll have some coconut water and goat-meat."

The waitron bowed and walked off toward the cookery.

Senara in a frustrated tone, her cheeks swollen, jaw tight, before she said, "Why didn't you let me speak?"

Elaria, gestured with her hand, "Are you out of your mind? We've never touched vine in our whole life, and besides drinking between sea voyage will make you spit it out the entire journey, before we reach Dragonweil."

"I also would've ordered their crab-stew," Senara squinted her eyes as she leant back in her chair, arms crossed.

"We've been eating fish since we left bayside landing, I think having something else, will feel refreshing," Elaria also squinting her eyes, in a sarcastic tone.

The waitron arrived with their food, he placed the meat on the table and pours in the coconut water in the wooden cups, "Anything else My ladies?"

Elaria shook her head, "No, thank you, we're good."

The waitron bowed and walked away.

Senara made a teasing face, her tongue coming out for a moment, as she sharpened her eyes looking at Elaria.

Elaria, pressed her lower lip under her teeth and squinted her eyes, she then gestured with her hand, "Eat it now, you'll have an entire day to whin about it later."

Elaria started eating the food, Senara sat with her arms closed for some moments, she looked at Elaria eating the meat that looked very good, she also looked back at her, giving those teasing stares as she bit off the meat, Senara then gave in and started to eat as well, Elaria's face lit up with a smile, Senara also grinned as they both enjoyed the meal.

After finishing, they paid the waitron the amount he asked, before they left the hall.

"...and then I killed that son of horse," the drunk continued his bragging as he gulped the vale, the rest cheered and laughed, clanking the cups together.
