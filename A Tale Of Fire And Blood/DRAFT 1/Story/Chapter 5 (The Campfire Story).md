# Chapter 5 (The Campfire Story)

Wind got colder as daylight faded, small waves pushed on the sand shores of the Island. Light from merchant stalls and the inns near the harbour glowed as they lit up torches and lamps. Captains and their crews made campfires near the trees or on the sand shore. Each of them slowly got surrounded by the crew and even some voyagers who sailed with them on their ships, stories were told, some shared their experiences from wars in the past, some bragged about making it out alive from a violent sea storm, some shared myths and legends from ancient times.

Elaria and Senara roamed around the area, gazing at the horizon as it grew dark. They came across young crew members from their own vessel, lighting up the wood for a campfire on the order of their captain. One of them looked at them both approaching, as they met gaze, Senara gestured the boy to come closer. The boy placed the wood aside, rubbed his dusty hands as he walked toward them.

"What's all this for?" Senara asked.

"The captain ordered us to set the campfire, for the night gathering," he answered as he slowed down and halted infront of them.

They both gestured him that they didn't understand the purpose.

"Oh yes..., you two ladies probably came here for the first time, well..., it's done by the captains who anchor here after days on the host'le seas," he turned around for a moment, "HURRY UP, THE CAPTAIN WILL BE HERE SOON," he gestured with hand before looking back at them, "The crew members gather around to have a few moments of pleasure, most of the times voyagers join as well."

"Great we'll join as well, come let us help you with the fire," Senara replied, voice loud enough for the boys behind to hear.

Elaria glared at her for a moment, Senara held her arm, "Come on you'll enjoy it I promise," she dragged her along with her. 

They both joined the young lads and after some moments the campfire was ready. The captain and the envoy arrived with some Azlari soldiers as well, the crew gathered around, the vale was shared, they started murmuring jokes and stories, some more people from the Shinobi joined them.

One of the older crew members, middle aged, wearing an old leather cap, his clothes worn from the long travels, raised his voice as he raised his hand to ask everyone to silent down, "All right y'all, let me tell you about war that happened just a few months back."

A young boy, who was from the Island, silenced his younger brother, eager to hear the story, "Quiet, that uncle is about to tell us a story."

Elaria and Senara also stopped murmuring as they looked at the man.

The man took gulped in some Vale as he started, "So this war happened just months ago between the mighty Zevarans and the Kingdom of Nalanda down south."

As she heard the word Zevarans, Elaria's focus got more strengthened, as she was going to live among them now for some time.

One of the younger boys raised his hand as he asked the man, "I'm sorry to interrupt sir..., but I'm curious, aren't you from Shinobi? so how did you get to know about the war?"

The man pointed his finger toward the boy, "That's a good question ma' boy. I'm a trader, I keep travelling around the seas, at times you'd see me at Shinobi and sometimes I'd be at the Zevarian inns gulping in vale and tearing through some good ol' meat."

The boy nodded, a friend sitting beside gave him a slight behind his head, he grabbed his hand tightly, as he was about to slap back, the captain gestured with a smile to not cause havoc. The boys then straightened.

The man then continued, "So as I' was sayin' this war started three summers ago, when the King got the word of the Nalandans preparing to invade from the south, he sent word to the nearing cities and the Dawngard Prince to get ready and send forces to meet them at the city of Sapphire Rock, the King rode out with his two sons. In two months they gathered at Sapphire Rock."

Everyone's gaze stuck as he explained, the young eager to know what happened next, he took a pause and chugged some more Vale. "Six hundred thousand," his voice intensified, "Zevaran and Dawngard once again combined their forces against a foreign enemy."

Elaria's eyes widened as she heard the number, sudden chill ran over the young, most of them listening to a war story for the first time.

"They travelled from Sapphire Rock to the mountains of Tibet to the South, where he ordered to split his army into three divisions. He led one of them himself, two hundred and fifty thousand," he paused to catch his breath, "One led by his eldest son Darius, two hundred thousand, and the third one led by his third son Arlen, one hundred and fifty thousand, little did they know what the Prince who was given the least number of men was about to do."

A crew member whispered to his friend while chugging the vale, "This'll be good."

The man then continued, explaining how they travelled and raided towns and plundered cities as they marched across the Tibet to the south.

A boy again interrupted, "And..., how do you all that? You're a trader right?"

The men looked at the boy, "Glad you asked, my' brother was in that war, he fought under the command of Prince Arlen."

The boy raised his brows in applaud, his lips tightened.

The man then continued with the tale of the war, telling them about the battles fought "The most significant battle among them all was the battle of Dharan, my brother calls it Fire against Elephants."

The envoy's jaw tightened as he heard about the Zevaran victories during the war, even though he was going there for an agreement but still he was from a rival state.

"This was the largest of the enemy hosts they were gonna face, Prince Arlen knew the importance of the battle that came into his share of the war, his father and brother were not close enough for him to ask for help," in a suspenceful tone, he continued, eyes widened, brows raised, "TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MEN ALONG WITH TWO THOUSAND ELEPHANTS."

A hush ran over crowd sitting around the camp fire. The man took a pause, drunk some vale, "Maybe that's enough for today, I'll tell the rest if we ever got the chance to sit together again," he jokingly said.

Everyone started aloud to ask him to continue, Senara stood up, "We ain't gonna travel back hundreds of ma'iles just ta' listen the next half of ya' story, come on finish it," she faked her pirate accent again, Elaria rolled her eyes as she listened her mimic pirates.

The man chugged in some more vale, he grinned, "Alright y'all, just kiddin' don't worry, I'll finish it."

Everyone became calm, Senara sat down, looking at Elaria with a tight smile she tilted her head, Elaria shook her head as a smile left her mouth as well.

"So...," the man continued, "The Prince knew he couldn't take em on in a straight out clash, so he did what every cunning commander would do, he decided to lure them in and weaken them, he knew if they win this one, they will win the war, and south's strength will break, if not fully, atleast to the point they won't think of drawing out blade against the Zevarans for a few years."

The group of men from the inn earlier also joined the group as they noticed the thrill and excitement on the younger ones faces, "somethin' good's goin' on here ey, let's join em," one of them said.

"Lucky for the Prince they reached the point, where the valley opened it's mouth to an open field, where battle would commence, a couple nights before the enemy," he took a pause before he threw some grapes into his mouth, "He ran his horse, along his commander around the field to explore it, seeing how he could use to his advantage." 

He continued explaining them about Arlen laying a rough map of the area and planning it with his friend who rode along the Army and the commander who was with him.

"When the enemy arrived, marching through the passages in the forest just across the field from where Arlen and his army was standing, they saw the Zevaran host and became assure that they would beat them, little did they know what was about to happen, the Prince ordered his archers who were on their horses to ride ahead, a thousand or two archers rode swiftly across the field, as they got close they started loosening their arrows, the enemy shot arrows back but they missed most of them," he took a breath, and asked for water, it was brought to him, he took a sip and continued, "in a matter of moments the archers took down the front line, in the first wave a thousand down, then they circled back, as the enemy cavalry charged ahead, they turned around toward them unleashing another wave of arrows that took down another couple thousand Nalandian horsemen."

"Why did he send only two thousand?" a young boy asked.

"Just wait my boy..., we're just getting to the good stuff," the men answered, pride in his voice.
"While the archers were shooting at the cavalry approaching, Arlen signalled his infantry to start backing off, they moved backwards, it was the signal for the archers to come back, after taking out almost five thousand of the enemy horsemen, the archers rode back, with the seventy five thousand cavalry following them, seeing the infantry move back, they increased their pace, as they entered the valley and crossed the point where Arlen wanted them to be, one of the riders blew a horn that echoed across the entire valley," he stood up now, gesturing with his hands every word he said, smiles ran across the elders who were from Zevaria.

Elaria and Senara looked at each other, their brows raised in aw, listening about the Prince made them curious about him.

Now the man's voice grew louder as more and more people started to gather around, they knew a war was fought in western lands but didn't knew much about the decisive battle at Dharan.

"As the rider blew the horn, the enemy horsemen slowed down as they felt something big, a thunder of hooves and screams filled the valley, from trees on both sides of the clearing, horsemen emerged, Arlen also charged at them with the two thousand archers now taking out the spears they had with them, the enemy cavalry now surrounded from three sides, couldn't form proper lines as it happened fast, five thousand wiped on the way there and now seventy thousand horsemen now cornered as fifty two thousand charged on them from three sides and within an hour, none left breathing."

"Where did the elephants go?" one crew member asked.

The man turned toward him, "As this was happening my boy..., the Nalandians send their elephants forward when they saw horsemen emerge , Arlen's friend, Fredrick Valdrek waited along with Trifon, when the elephants neared the point they waited for them, Fredrick ordered the archers and flaming arrows were set loose," his voice louder as he danced around the campfire, "when those arrows hit the ground, BOOOM. Fire rose from in their faces, many even burnt with it."

Chills ran across the camp, their mouths curved in aw, jaws dropped as he explained.

"The elephants were overwhelmed, fire rose from the ground and arrows rained on them from both sides, they turned and ran back toward their army, the enemy cavalry that was surrounded in the valley now was completely wiped out, a couple thousand lives were lost from Prince Arlen's host as well, the elephants ran back and over their own lines, scattering them and the Nalandian formation in the centre broke, as hundreds of elephants ran over, crushing their own men beneath their feet..., give me water please," he paused as his throat became dry, Senara handed him a waterskin, he gulped it down.

The boys murmured among themselves, "So that's why they call him the Prince who brought the South to it's knees," one of them said. 

The other answered, "I wish I was like him."

"The enemy army was scattered and demoralised, their elephants either burnt, shot down, or escaped from the battlefield, their cavalry wiped out, but still most of their men were alive, though their will shattered, the elephants trumpled over thirty thousand of their own  along with many of their generals, the Prince watched as the elephants run over them and disappear in the dense forest behind them, now the odds almost evened, he ordered his entire army to charge at them, the archers rode first, loosening thousands of arrows on them, the enemy's archers now formed a line and shot back, but couldn't target them properly, the Zevarans were too fast for them, still three or four hundred were shot down, it was just a matter of moments before the cavalry arrived with the Prince himself leading it and started to pierce the enemy lines."

Elaria and Senara were amazed by the young Prince's tactics and the way the man told the story made it sound even more intriguing, "some Prince he is," Senara said, tilting her head slightly as she looked at Elaria, she nodded in approval.

"Fredrick Valdrek and Trifon then signalled the Zevaran infantry to move, the enemy was not done dealing with the turmoil the elephants caused, and heavy charge from the cavalry, and now the eighty thousand strong infantry followed, seeing them approach, many of the Nalandians threw their weapons on field and fled, escaping from the field through the forest, many were killed by the archers, now when the infantries from both sides clashed," he took a breath, "It was not long before the Zevarans broke through and the Nalandians men started to fall in masses, the battle was won by the Zevarans and the South was broken, only a few thousand out of two hundred fifty thousand Nalandians survived, with the Zevarans loosing just a few thousand," he gestured with his hand, "Word reached the King, he then rode to Dharan where the battle was fought, it took them around four days, Prince Darius reached with his men as well, Prince Arlen was declared hero of the war and crowned heir at the age of just seventeen, in front of half a million Zevaran and Dawngard men, before they marched home, the war was won by Zevaria, winning eight out of ten major battles, the Nalandians lost the entire plateau of Tibet, now divided between Zevaria and Dawngard, along with Dharan."

The camp burst out with murmurs across the men, the young praised the Prince and felt proud about being from Zevaria, the ones from Shinobi were amazed but still had mixed reactions, as they were from Azlari kingdom. The envoy now knew what kind of power the Zevarans were on ground, despite their weaknesses in naval war.

Everyone left the spot and went back to the inns they were going to spend the night, Elaria and Senara while walking back talked about the story, "Is it strange I want to meet this Prince even more now," Senara in a teasing tone, Elaria admired the tactics used by Arlen and also reminded her that they were on a mission. A hush ran over as campfires were taken out and everyone left the shores to go and have a night of rest before the long voyages ahead of them.
