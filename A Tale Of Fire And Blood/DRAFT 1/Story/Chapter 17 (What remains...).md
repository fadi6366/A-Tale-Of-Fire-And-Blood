# Chapter 17 (What remains...)

**9th, Bloomrise ,1701 AC...**

The sky had cleared from the last day's rain. The horizon lit blue as dawn approached. At the site of the ambush there was complete hush, dead soldiers lay on the ground, covered in mud and their own blood.

Arlen groaned in pain, furrowing his brows. A few moments later he slowly opened his eyes. He felt the warmth of someone's hand beneath his neck. His eyes opened, everything seemed blurred for a moment. A cloaked figure sat beside him. Her eyes violet, head covered by the dark cloak, skin fair. They met gaze for a couple moments, she swallowed. "Zhei en vhem," she said politely. 

He couldn't understand what she said, his gaze lingered on the blue tiara on head. After a couple moments the sight of her hazed out. Her heart skipped a beat for a moment as Arlen faded out, eyes widened. She placed her hand on his chest and fingers by the throat, his heart was still beating. She let out a sigh in relief.

She gently let placed him down before standing up. Her gaze scoured the town for any other survivor. Her shoes splashed the mud as she roamed around for a while, inspecting the ones laying down. The horizon was lighting up as the day was approaching. She didn't want to be spotted, but she also didn't want to leave anyone suffering to death. After she had assured no one survived she approached Arlen.

She gazed around and spotted a cart, it's wheel broken and a part of it burnt but would work. She didn't have enough time but managed to gather some pieces of wood. After a while it was manageable enough to carry one person. She then dragged Arlen onto it and tied it to her horse. She took off the cloaks of a couple dead ones who had ambushed them and covered Arlen with them.

She then mounted her white horse, her eyes gazed at the field and the dead for one last time before she snapped the reins. And her mount strode away from the field. She turned around a few times to make sure the kart wouldn't break, when her heart was at peace with it she snapped the reins and her mount picked up the pace. The wheels creaked as she rode off, taking the Prince with her and leaving the dead behind.

Later when the sun rose and the cool winds turned warmer. A couple dozen riders entered the town, holding the Zevaran and Varangian banners in hand. Gaedric rode at front followed by Irric and Nikon, Bryndan's brother.

"My God!" Gaedric's eyes widened, seeing the sight of corpses piled up at the centre of the town, the same scene Arlen saw a day before. He dismounted and looked around at the dead soldiers, searching for survivors.

Nikon's jaw tightened as his gaze lingered on Fredrick who lay lifeless. He rushed toward him and knelt. He shook him quickly, "Lord Fredrick, wake up My Lord." His eye caught the sight of the wound that pierced through Fred's torso. Nikon now knew he wasn't alive as his body had also gone cold. _The Valdreks won't be so happy after hearing thi-_ 

His eye suddenly caught at Bryndan. "No,"No!" he rushed toward his brother, heart racing and eyes tearing up. He shrugged Bryndan, pleading him to wake up. "Don't do this to us brother," he cried loudly, tears rushing down his face, cheeks and eyes gone red. He placed his head on his brother's chest and grabbed his hand as he burst into crying.

Irric stepped closer from behind, "He's gone. All of them," he paused. Nikon lifted his head. "None of them is alive," Irric added.

Another soldier approached, "Captain, no sign of the Prince."

Nikon lifted his head, eyes red and face wet from the tears, "what? what do you mean no sign of the Prince?"

"He's not here, they must have took him, Captain."

"The Vargoth assassins are not the kind who would take hostages," Irric remarked.

Nikon looked at him, "Then where is he? Even if didn't survive, his body should-". He saw Arlen's sword laying by Fredrick's body. He rushed toward it and grabbed it. "This is his sword," he paused for a moment.

"Any signs of the Prince?" Gaedric approached.

Nikon shook his head, "no, we only found his sword."

"I'm sorry for your brother," Gaedric said.

Nikon nodded, tears coming from his eyes.

"Where is he?" Gaedric cried loudly.

"Look," Irric said. "Tracks," he pointed at the marks left the the kart wheels. "They must have took him on a cart."

"But you said they don't take hostages," Nikon replied.

"Yes, that's what bothering me now."

"Maybe this was an exception?"

"No, they don't. No matter who you are, they just cut you down at the spot."

"Then someone else must have found him alive, and maybe took him with them."

Irric shrugged.

Gaedric called out a handful of men, "Follow these tracks. Whoever took the Prince, these must be theirs."

The soldiers bowed, with fists on their chest and quickly mounted their horses. 

"I'll go as well," Nikon said.

Gaedric nodded. 

Nikon looked at Bryndan and Fred's bodies. " Take them to the fort. I would want to be at the Lord son and my brother's funeral." He mounted his horse and followed the tracks along with the men.

Gaedric cried, "BRING THE KARTS!!!"

Wooden wheels creaked as they brought them. The dead along with Fred and Bryndan were dragged onto them. The ones who they couldn't take back were buried there along with the people of the town.

Gaedric and Irric looked at the tracks and the riders that strode away in the distance. "Let's pray the Prince is alive," Gaedric said, meeting Irric's gaze.

"Yes, or God knows what the King will do if he gets the word his heir is no more," Irric answered.

"If someone has taken him, it means he is alive, don't worry. Our men will find him," Gaedric gave Irric a pat on the shoulder. Both of them mounted their horses. The ones who didn't get the room on the karts were buried there along with the villagers, men, women, children and the old.
