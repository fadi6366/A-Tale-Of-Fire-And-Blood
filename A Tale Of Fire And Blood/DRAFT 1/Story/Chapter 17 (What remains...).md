# Chapter 17 (What remains...)

**9th, Bloomrise ,1701 AC...**

The sky had cleared from the last day's rain. The horizon lit blue as dawn approached. At the site of the ambush there was complete hush, dead soldiers lay on the ground, covered in mud and their own blood.

Arlen groaned in pain, furrowing his brows. A few moments later he slowly opened his eyes. He felt the warmth of someone's hand beneath his neck. His eyes opened, everything seemed blurred for a moment. A cloaked figure sat beside him. Her eyes violet, head covered by the dark cloak, skin fair. They met gaze for a couple moments, she swallowed. "Zhei en vhem," she said politely. 

He couldn't understand what she said, his gaze lingered on the blue tiara on head. After a couple moments the sight of her hazed out. Her heart skipped a beat for a moment as Arlen faded out, eyes widened. She placed her hand on his chest and fingers by the throat, his heart was still beating. She let out a sigh in relief.

She gently let placed him down before standing up. Her gaze scoured the town for any other survivor. Her shoes splashed the mud as she roamed around for a while, inspecting the ones laying down. The horizon was lighting up as the day was approaching.
