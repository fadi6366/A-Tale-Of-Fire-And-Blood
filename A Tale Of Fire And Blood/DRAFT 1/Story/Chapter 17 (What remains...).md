# Chapter 17 (What remains...)

**9th, Bloomrise ,1701 AC...**

The sky had cleared from the last day's rain. The horizon lit blue as dawn approached. At the site of the ambush there was complete hush, dead soldiers lay on the ground, covered in mud and their own blood.

Arlen groaned in pain, furrowing his brows. A few moments later he slowly opened his eyes. He felt the warmth of someone's hand beneath his neck. His eyes opened, everything seemed blurred for a moment. A cloaked figure sat beside him. Her eyes violet, head covered by the dark cloak, skin fair. They met gaze for a couple moments, she swallowed. "Zhei en vhem," she said politely. 

He couldn't understand what she said, his gaze lingered on the blue tiara on head. After a couple moments the sight of her hazed out. Her heart skipped a beat for a moment as Arlen faded out, eyes widened. She placed her hand on his chest and fingers by the throat, his heart was still beating. She let out a sigh in relief.

She gently let placed him down before standing up. Her gaze scoured the town for any other survivor. Her shoes splashed the mud as she roamed around for a while, inspecting the ones laying down. The horizon was lighting up as the day was approaching. She didn't want to be spotted, but she also didn't want to leave anyone suffering to death. After she had assured no one survived she approached Arlen.

She gazed around and spotted a cart, it's wheel broken and a part of it burnt but would work. She didn't have enough time but managed to gather some pieces of wood. After a while it was manageable enough to carry one person. She then dragged Arlen onto it and tied it to her horse. She took off the cloaks of a couple dead ones who had ambushed them and covered Arlen with them.

She then mounted her white horse, her eyes gazed at the field and the dead for one last time before she snapped the reins. And her mount strode away from the field. She turned around a few times to make sure the kart wouldn't break, when her heart was at peace with it she snapped the reins and her mount picked up the pace. The wheels creaked as she rode off, taking the Prince with her and leaving the dead behind.
