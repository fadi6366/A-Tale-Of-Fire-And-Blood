# Chapter 13 (Echoes from West)

The heavens spoke a different tale on the western side of the Black Peaks. Thick clouds covered the sky, the sun nowhere to be seen. It seemed like another rain arming itself to pour down on Fallowmere, a small town in the western marches. Emer's garment flapped as the wind rushed across the town, eyes squinted as he strode in the cold. A young boy merely fifteen, Emer was walking to the merchant to buy some turnips his mother asked to prepare the night's meal.

Emer looked at the darkening cover, _It'll rain soon, I better be quick._  Horse hooves, dull thuds, beats rolling through the wind. Emir turned toward the town entrance. A few dozen riders coming in, heads cloaked in black. _Hmmhh... traders? Might be_ He guessed _From the south_ Horses covered in coarse canvas, walked in.  

Emer approached the merchant, the man smiled at the boy and asked what he needed. Emer asked for the turnips. He nodded and started putting them in a sack. Emer looked outside, it had started to drizzle. The soft clicks of the water striking the ground, cold wind rushing. "Here you go," the merchant said, handing him over the sack.

Emer nodded and handed him over three silver coins. He took the sack and walked out. As the shop's cover disappeared over his head, the cold drop fell on his neck sending a shiver down his body. Emer then started to run, his feet splashing the mud.

The wooden door creaked as he slowly swung it open. Emer stepped in the hut and quickly closed it behind him. The drizzle had quickened up as he was running home, wetening him completely. Fortunately the turnips were safe from the rain. His mother saw him and said, "I'd told you to be quick, look now you're wet in the rain, go change it or you'll get sick."

He handed the turnips over to her as she started to prepare the dinner. Emer took off his clothes and put on the dry ones. He then put the wet near the fireplace to dry, sitting down beside gazing at the flames. For a few moments he sat there in the warmth, forgetting the cold outside. "Emer..., Emer," his mother called him. The food was ready. _Finally_ Emer stood up and went to his mother.

She put the turnips stew and water on the table. Emer took a bite and started to chew. Just as his mother put it for herself to eat, a couple of horse neighs came from outside. Cries of the young, clanging of blades, Emer's brows furrowed. He stood up and walked toward the door. His mother told him not to go, but he didn't listen.

Emer opened the door and saw the riders on their horses rushing through the town, swinging their dark blades. Anyone who came in the way was being cut down. His eyes widened as a rider sliced the throats of two young girls barely six or seven of age in front him. He saw their bodies shiver as the blood poured out with the last essence of life from their bodies. Emer's heart started to race, seeing them two struggled to death. 

Emer quickly rushed back inside his house. He ran to his late father's room who used to serve in the Varangian guard but was killed in an ambush. Emer took out the sword from an old box. His mother saw him leave with the blade, she asked in worry, "Where are you going? What is happening outside?"

"We're under attack," he answered, his fist gripping on the handle. 

"You can't fight them alone," she answered putting her hand on his cheek.

"I know mother, but I can't just sit inside waiting, while they cut down our people, this is what father stood up for and I will do as well," he answered, placing his hand on her hand. Both mother and child embraced as if they knew that this was their last. 

For a moment fear crawled up as Emer put his hand on the door handle. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, and then opened the door, "Don't let anyone in," he said, looking at his mother. He then closed the door behind and walked out with the blade. He turned toward a rider who had dismounted his horse and was walking toward a young boy. "Hey," Emer shouted, eyes sharpened as he walked toward the dark cloaked raider.

The man turned toward him and grinned. Emer rushed toward him swinging his sword, but the attacker was quick, dodging Emer's strike and hitting him. Emer felt a sharp pain as the raider's sword struck him in his back. Emer held a shout from the pain, breathing quickly he turned around, struggling to stand. He looked the man in the eyes and tried to strike again, swinging his sword and shouting.

Emer got close to him and the raider lowered himself and pushed his blade straight through Emer's gut. Emer's sword fell down from his hand, he felt a pain through his abdomen. The rider pulled out his blade quickly. Emer fell down on his knees, a metallic taste filling up his mouth. Blood trickled down his chin, as he felt his strength fade. The rider struck him once again with the blade cutting Emer's throat this time. He looked at the rider as he choked and feel to the ground. He spat out blood as he saw the world slowly faded into darkness. The rider spat on the young boy's lifeless corpse, walking away. 

The town was under total chaos now. The riders killed anyone who came their way. They broke into the huts of the people, cutting down any living soul and taking away any useful thing they could find. They had even entered Emer's house and killed his mother, burning it afterward.

A young boy merely eight hid and his younger brother merely five or six, hid behind a turned over cart. Both their hearts raced, eyes wet from the tears, bodies shivering in the cold. Their parents had been slaughtered just a few moments ago in front of them. The younger one screamed loud as he was grabber a man who appeared behind them. The older brother turned and saw the rider slice his brother's throat. He screamed, "NOOO...," picking up a rock and striking the man's eye. The rider cried in pain as the pointy side of the rock had decimated his eye. 

The boy ran as fast as his legs could take him. An arrow hissed through the air from behind and struck him in the throat. He stumbled and fell, clutching at the shaft as his breath came out in broken, wheezing gasps. No scream followed, only a wet choke. The world dimmed around him, and then it was gone.

Fallowmere was nothing but a ghost of itself now. Houses burning, bodies cooling in the dirt. The raiders took what they wanted and left the rest to rot.

***

Back at Zevaragrad, after the court ended everyone had left the great hall. Though it wasn't the peak now but still cold winds blew often. Everyone had gone inside their chambers, escaping the cold. Arlen sat in his room, sitting on his bed. Julia, his younger sister sat in the chair just opposite to the Prince. 

"You don't seem quite happy about the court," Julia asked looking at her brother.

Arlen faintly shook his head, gaze at the floor, letting out a sigh. "Not quiet," he paused. His breath heavy, heartbeat not quiet calm. "I don't know," meeting her gaze he said.

"Why? What happened?" she asked.

Arlen broke gaze, he didn't answer. Julia said after a couple moments, "It's about the girl, right?"

"What?" Arlen said, furrowing his brows.

"Oh..., don't think I'm not aware enough of your eyes following her whenever she's around you."

He took a breath, looking at Julia and smiling. "Is it that obvious?"

"Yes..., I saw it the moment you arrived at the Palace with them, the way you were smiling when she held your hand, coming out of the carriage," Julia replied, a bright smile on her face.

Arlen raised a brow and nodded, his mouth widening. He tightened his jaw for a moment, letting out a sigh. "Yes..., you can say it's about her."

"Then shouldn't you be happy? I mean father let her stay here at the palace."

"I don't know if I, should be happy or worried," he looked at Julia.

"Worried for what?"

He stood up, slowly taking steps across the room. "The day I saw her the first time, Maria told me I should be careful. And you saw what happened at dinner last night."

"You're just mixing up words now, brother. Just tell me what's bothering you."

"She's from the Azlari court, and you know we haven't been on good terms with them in the last few decades. The only thing keeping us from getting each other's throats is that truce," he said, Julia nodded. He took a couple steps toward her. "Do you think that letting them make those trade centres, we've done the right thing?"

She curled her lips, "I, I don't know for sure, well they are our rivals anyway." Arlen swallowed, his chest heavy and every breath seeming difficult. She continued, "I mean..., they did seemed shocked when father told the girl they will stay together."

He closed his eyes for a moment, nodding, he left out a sigh and opened them. He knelt, placing his hand on the chair's arm, looking into Julia's eyes. "Look, promise me you won't tell this to anyone."

Her brows furrowed, "tell anyone what?"

"Promise..., me!"

"Fine, I won't."

Arlen looked at her face, he knew she wasn't lying, being one of the few in the family who truly understood him. "Last night...," he swallowed. "I went to the guest chamber, I..., met her." Julia's nodded. "We talked a little," his heart raced. "Then she told me, they wanted trade centres in our lands, especially one here, in Zevaragrad."

"But they didn't ask for it today in the court," she said, furrowing her brows.

Arlen shook his head, "No, they didn't. Because, I told her that father won't accept them having one in the Capital." Her brows relaxed, the slight curve on her lips also vanished. Arlen then continued, "I, told her that father won't also allow their men to look after the centres, I told her..., I told her how to present the offer so that father will accept it and allow them-"

Julia cut him off, "You mean allow her."

"Yes, allow her to stay here, at the Palace."

Julia straightened in her chair. Arlen blew his lips, looking at her, a faint grin on his face but jaw tight.

"So you allowed them to get what they wanted easily."

"Yes."

"You wanted her to stay."

"Yes."

"Then why are you worried?"

"I, I am not worried, I-"

Their gaze shifted at the door after hearing a sudden knock. Both of them stood up. 

"Yes?" Arlen asked.

The door creaked as it swung open. It was Julian, leaning in. He looked at Arlen, and gestured with his brows.

"What?" Arlen asked.

"Father wants you in his solar, apparently he needs you to go somewhere."

"Where?" Arlen asked as he put on his tailcoat. 

"I don't know, he just read the letter, a messenger brought and told me to call you."

"Fine," he looked at Julia, "we'll talk later about this," he whispered. Julia nodded. "Let's go," he said as he walked toward the door.

Julian looked at Julia, "You'll sit here?"

"Yes, for now," she answered.

He nodded and closed the door.

Both of them strode toward the King's solar. Helene saw them leave the room, she knew it was something important as they were in a hurry. She met Lilly's gaze who was just beside her.

Julian gestured the guard standing outside the solar and he opened the door. Theron sat on the chair right across, staring at the letter. The messenger stood a few paces from the table. Both the brothers walked in.

"You summoned me, father," Arlen said.

Theron looked at his son, who had halted just near the table in front.

He placed the letter on the table.

"The Vargoth have sent their assassins to our lands." Arlen clenched his jaw, his brows tightened. "Apparently they have established a strong hold in the Serpent's Nest," Theron said.

"How did they get in?" Arlen turned toward the messenger, " the Varangian Guard, what are they doing?"

"That is why I'm sending you to the west," Arlen looked at Theron as the King spoke. "You'll head there and find out what is going on," he pointed at the letter, "and take care of these assassins and their strong hold." Arlen swallowed. "You'll ride to greywatch and meet commander Miron there."

Arlen bowed, his fist on his chest, "As you wish, Your Highness."

"You have six days to prepare, gather your best men from the fifty thousand granted to you." Theron gestured with his hand, that Arlen may leave.

Arlen nodded before he turned toward the door and walked out. Another battle awaited the Prince now. This one might not be like the ones he fought before. He'll be heading to lands he was not familiar with, this time without his father or brothers beside him.

***

**Later that evening,**

Darius stood on the wall of the Royal Palace, staring ahead at the vast Capital city. His head covered by his cloak, and his gaze sharp as his eyes lingered from corner to the other. He heard footsteps, echoing in the calm. Darius turned to his right, only to see Julian approach him. He had his cloak covering him but not the head. Both brothers shared a grin and nodded.

"What makes you stand here in the cold wind?" Julian asked as he halted beside Darius.

"Nothing, I was just looking at our glorious Capital."

"Indeed, it is glorious."

Darius let out a smirk, "Only waiting to be teared down by an inexperienced heir."

"Calling him inexperienced, you're underestimating him," Julian answered resting his arms at the merlon, both their gaze ahead at the horizon.

"He's still young, doesn't know how to react to his own emotions, I call that inexperience."

"He's won battles, that doesn't come from inexperience."

"Having hundreds of thousands of men by your side, having the best commanders with you. That's enough to win a fight even when you're a little boy," Darius answered.

Julian didn't say anything, he let out a sigh. He knew if he praised Arlen just slightly more Darius would throw him off the wall. He just nodded. "Well, you might have heard about his new quest."

"He's heading west, to Greywatch," Darius replied looking at Julian.

"Yes."

"All alone, by himself."

"Rodion might ride alongside him, father told him to take the best men from the ones granted to him," Julian answered.

"Tell Nikolai to get ready, he'll be heading west alongside him."

"You think Arlen will let him go by his side? He's always with you."

"Nikolai is one of those who are under his command, even if he doesn't want, Nikolai will talk him into taking him along as well." Darius smirked, "After all, our brother has a soft heart."

Julian's lip curved to a smile. His gaze caught the sight of Fredrick who was walking toward the Palace gate. "He will ride as well, Arlen trusts him to be by his side."

Darius looked down at him, meeting his gaze for a couple moments. Darius tightened his jaw, his stare cold as he watched the Valdrek heir enter the Palace. 

***

Fredrick walked in through the Palace gate. He saw Lilly walking across the courtyard carrying a sack. Fredrick called her out, she halted and toward him. 

"Yes? My lord," she said.

"Where is Arlen and Jason?" Fredrick asked.

"They're in the guest chamber My Lord," Lilly replied.

Fredrick nodded and walked toward Jason's chamber. He climbed the stairs to the upper floor and strode across the gallery to the room. The door creaked as he pushed it open slowly. 

"I think God has given you fingers to knock the door at least," Jason said with a smile.

"Why would I need to knock when I know you two idiots are inside," Fredrick replied as he closed it behind him. He sat on the chair in front of them. 

Arlen watched him as he took his seat, "Where were you?" he asked.

"I was just wandering around the city", Fredrick replied as he sat down. "Why? What happened?"

"There has been raids, in the west, well..., west of the Black Peaks. And, father wants me to go take care of it," Arlen replied.

" And His Highness wants you to go alongside him," Jason remarked, pointing toward Arlen. The Prince rolled his eyes and smiled.

"I'd be more than happy to join you, when are we going?" Fredrick said.

"In six days," Arlen paused. "First day of the month of Snowtide."

"You mean, the upcoming Flamerox?"

"Yes," Arlen nodded.

"There goes the Spring festival then, it will take you weeks to reach there," Jason said.

"I know but, it is what it is," Arlen grabbed Jason's shoulder, "duty calls."

"How many men will you take with us?" Fred asked, looking at Arlen.

"I think a couple thousand, if the Varangian have sent word to the Capital, then it means the threat is serious." Fredrick nodded. " We also can't take an entire army if we wish to reach there quickly." 

"And, what if you need more men?" Jason asked.

"We can send word to the nearing cities there," Arlen answered.  

Jason nodded. "Mother will ask for you, when I return home," he added, looking at Fredrick.

"Tell her I'll be home soon, it's a brief visit to a nearby western city."

Jason nodded.

"Father ordered Senara to go to Elmorne at the court," Arlen said.

"Oh yes..., what about that actually," Jason asked.

"They wanted some trade centres here in our lands, father agreed but he wants Elaria to stay here and her friend to go to the trade centre they will setup in Elmorne," Arlen answered.

Jason looked at Fredrick. Arlen saw it on his face, "You leave for Elmorne tomorrow with her and then head home from there."

Jason let out a sigh, with a smile on his face. Fredrick gave him a pat on his back. "Don't get too out of hand there," he said with a wink.

Arlen let out a laugh, "No..., no, I know him, he won't."

Jason's face slightly reddened, he didn't answer.

A final moment between them before they would get separated again. One will head home and the others on a campaign west, with no clue of what could happen there.

***

**The Next day,**  

After days of sunlight and cloud cover playing hide and seek, it had finally snowed. Even though winter was slowly leaving but it did show it's presence during these days. The snow wasn't enough for everything around to become white, but enough for everyone to cover themselves up. The faint sunlight also tried to get through the thick cover.

Arlen shivered as he strode out, a grin on his face as his gaze lingered upon Jason who stood by the horse. He clapped his hand over Jason's. Looking up he said, "Not what I had expected for the day of your departure from here."

Jason said, "Yes, me neither," letting out mist as he spoke.

"You both will be by yourselves there, it's your chance to finally know what feels of you," Arlen said as they both saw Senara walk out with Elaria. "But," he grabbed Jason's arm politely, "don't get too ahead of yourself."

Jason answered, "Don't worry, I won't," meeting gaze with Senara as she approached.

Arlen nodded politely, "I hope your days here at the Capital were well spent, Lady Senara."

She answered, "They sure were great, Your Highness. I'm grateful of the hospitality you all have shown," with a bow. Arlen met Elaria's gaze, she tilted her head with a smile.

Fredrick walked out and climbed down the steps. He approached his brother and they both embraced. "Tell Mother and Father, I'll be home soon," he said.

Backing off politely Jason replied, "I will, and you take care of yourself there," Jason turned his eye at Victoria who stood on the steps. "We won't be the only ones who will wait for you, brother."

Fredrick turned slightly toward her, enough to get a glance. "I know," he replied turning toward his brother. "Look after the Pinereach and Mother and Father while I'm gone."

Jason nodded, and they let go of each other. He looked at Arlen, "Where is your annoying little brother?"

"Picking up the weapons you left in your room, puffin face," Eran cried out loud as he walked down the steps, holding a sword and a dagger.  

All of them let out a laugh, Arlen meeting Elaria's gaze. His heart skipped a beat seeing the smile on her face while they both glanced into each other's eyes.

"You should eat almonds to improve your memory," Eran said as he handed Jason over the sword and dagger.

Jason smiled as both of them embraced. "When will you come again?" Eran said in a low voice, his smile fading out. 

"As soon as the Prince returns home with my brother," Jason answered, his lips curved.

Eran nodded as he took a couple steps back. Jason then put his foot on the saddle and swung on the horse. Elaria and Senara also shared an embrace, "Keep sending the letters," Senara whispered. Elaria nodded as they both let go. Senara then mounted the horse. She put on the cloak over her head. 

Jason turned his mount toward the Palace gate, the soldiers standing there also mounted their horses. Jason splashed his reign and the Stallion started to stride ahead. It's hooves echoed over the floor. Senara followed behind. Elaria stared at them as they left the Palace and the guards swung it close behind them.

***

**Two days later 34th Glacivar 1701 AC** 

The couple days of travel had seemed to go by in the blink of an eye. Both Jason and Senara had spent their time well on the road. Sharing meals over the campfires and a night spent in an inn on the way due to a blizzard that visited the same day they had left Zevaragrad. Elmorne seemed very much like Zevaragrad as it was the second most crucial city in these lands and was on the crossroads. 

The trade centre was established as the permission given by the King. The grand inn was chosen for the purpose. The city governor appointed the owner of the City market in charge of the centre. Jason helped Senara in everything needed to be done on the day. It was not difficult for the last cracks to open after weeks of spending together with him on the road and in the Palace.

Night had fallen over Elmorne. The city streets covered in the gold and grey of the lamps and torches. It looked more beautiful at night than the Capital. Senara stood on the balcony of her room in the Grand inn as she gazed at the city.

She heard footsteps approach from behind, she turned around to see Jason. Both of them shared gaze and a warm smile. Despite the blizzard a couple nights ago the day had been warmer comparatively. This night was cold though but not like the ones prior to it.

"The city is beautiful isn't it?" Senara said as she looked at it.

"It is, I wonder why they didn't make this one the Capital," Jason answered, staring at the blooming city lights.

"Maybe some things are pretty left untouched," she answered.

_Well doesn't seem very untouched. It's as much as chaotic as Zevaragrad. Oh anyways..._ "Well, speaking or pretty...," Jason reached out to a pocket in his cloak. His hand came out with a beautiful locket. A rose carved onto the golden and silver pendant, sun setting behind it, spreading it's rays everywhere. He straightened his palm with the locket on it. It looked more beautiful in the light coming from the lamp. 

Her eyes lit up seeing the beautiful locket he had brought for her. Her jaw dropped, she hadn't a locket more beautiful than this, nor did anyone had gifted her such a thing.

"I bought this a day before we left Zevaragrad, I'll be leaving tomorrow for Pinereach so..., I thought that I might," he stuttered. "I thought of giving you something, after all the days we've spent together and..." 

"It's beautiful," Senara gasped as she said. "You didn't have to do this."

"It's nothing really, I just-"

Jason was speaking as Senara wrapped her arms around him, a warm embrace in the cold night. Jason swallowed as his heart raced. He also took her into his arms softly. Maybe this was what she had told him to wait for. The gift he had presented might have melted the ice. What followed the embrace was something both of them hadn't expected.

**The next day,**

It was the time now for the Valdrek Lordson to head home. He mounted his horse and shared a glance with Senara who wore the locket he gifted on her neck. Both smiled at each other and shared a nod. Jason splashed the reign and his horse galloped toward the road, followed by the soldiers. Weeks of travel on the road, then the stay at the Capital and now Elmorne. The moment had finally came for Jason which he waited for. 

Though he didn't expect it to happen so quickly. She had come too close to him that it felt like a dream. What could lead both of them into massive turmoil it things went off road. Whatever the future had in store, the spy and the Lordson had made the slip, now only waiting for time to reveal how much it would scar the both of them.
