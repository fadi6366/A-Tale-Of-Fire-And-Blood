# Prologue

_Nero curled his fingers, a blue flash of lightening appeared as he brought them closer. He moved his hand from his side to front, his feet firm in the ground. He felt himself weakening because his blood was now starting to drain from the power he was using as he stood to deliver a final blow. Nero pulled his hand back and then pushed it forward, the bolt surged toward Orin, who approached him, he forehead curled, burning eyes glaring at Nero. Orin tightened his fists and crossed up his arms in front of himself, lowering his head. A wall of flame rose, covering him and blocking the bolt. Nero's eyes widened as he saw the bolt fade into the flames._  

_The wall faded with Orin emerging from it. He jumped and pulled his back and as he threw it ahead, flames emerged from his fist. Nero now completely drained had nothing to cover him. The flame struck him and burnt a part of his face and armour. He fell back and a sharp rock struck against his back. He cried out in pain as he his eyes looked at the dark clouds that covered a few parts of the red sky._

_Water from a nearby puddle rose as Orin gestured with his hand, opening his fingers. Nero's eyes widened as the water thinned into a bladelike shape. Orin stiffed his fingers together and moved his hand like slicing with a sword. The blade struck Nero on the chest twice before it splattered down as Orin loosed his hand. Nero screamed, blood ran down from the wound. He knew this was his last few moments as the red poured out._

_"Tell your master..., he chose a weak one, his reign of terror will no longer haunt this world." Orin took quick breaths as he said, his voice loud and tone hard. His eyes wide open and a hint of a smile on his teeth._

_"You..., you think..., this is over?" Nero said, his eyes fainting as he tried to keep them open. His hand on the wound, taking slow breaths. "You may have prevailed over me...," he swallowed, his breath slowed down, "But..., he will always be there..., watching this world... Many heralds like me will come..., this is just the beginning..., the world you thrive for will fall."_ 

_Orin's jaw tightened, the faint smile on his face vanished, "Then the descendants of the Flame Bringer will be there to stop them when the time arrives." he answered, looking Nero in the eyes._

_Orin then dragged out his sword from the sheath. It's blade reflected the light from the sky, it's hilt with flame embarked on it. Nero's eyes lifted toward the blade as it came down in a flash. Slicing his throat. He put his hand just below the cut, blood started to pour out of his mouth. He saw the world fade into darkness, his hand a dropped, head lowered. His eyes yet open as his body now lied there lifeless._

_Orin looked up at the sky as it cleared, the dark clouds now slowly brightened and the red faded into blue. The dark power was defeated, for now. This marked the beginning of a cycle that would repeat itself every few centuries. One that would put good and evil as odds for many generations to come. A dark force that will always be there, waiting to linger it's shadow upon the world._
