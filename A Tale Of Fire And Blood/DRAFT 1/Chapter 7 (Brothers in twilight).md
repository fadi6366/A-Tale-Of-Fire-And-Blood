# Chapter 7 (Brothers in twilight)

**Five days Later, 8th Frostveil 1700 AC**

The five nights at Dawngard passed quickly, they'd rested well enough now after days of sailing and before the long journey on the road that would take them months. The palace covered in white, after the blizzard in the night. The dark cloak of the night was uncovering, as dawn slowly approached. Clouds covered the dark blue sky as it started to light up.

The candle on the small desk beside the glass window flickered, throwing pale gold and grey across the room. Elaria lied on the bed, her brows furrowed as she changed sides, it seemed she was seeing something uncomforting, her eyes suddenly opened as she woke up, she felt a slight burn in her chest. Reaching out for the cup on the table, just on her bed-side. She took a few sips of the water, as she caught her breath, she couldn't comprehend what she saw, her eyes wide, brows lifted. She turned her stare around the room and eventually at the window, it was still dark outside, dawn approached but still dark. 

Elaria couldn't sleep, neither was she able to understand what she saw, it never had happened to her before. She got out of her bed, changed her dress. It was cold outside, she wrapped the cloak around her, as she left the room. She went outside to take some fresh air, she stood in the balcony, staring at the sky and a couple times the courtyard below. The cold breeze brushed her hair against her face, her eyes squinted, she wanted to go sleep but couldn't, the reason she came outside. _What was that? What does it mean? I never had such a dream before. Maybe I'm worrying too much, why did my chest burn when I woke up, I can't sleep and there is this long road ahead, great, it had to come today_. 

She stood there for quiet some time, the sky now lit up as dawn came, the birds started to chirp, the sweet sound of the greenbul felt a delight to the ears, the cloud cover slowly started to let the sun through. She let a yawn out, knowing she'll fall asleep standing there if she doesn't go back. Elaria returned to her room, she changed back to the night drapes, and lied down on her bed, took over the blanket, she closed her eyes and after some moments dozed off.

***

A knock on the door, Elaria was asleep, no answer from her. Fingers clicked against the door a couple more times, but harder and louder, "Elaria?" it was Senara, she was there to wake her up as she had slept for long now, Maria had sent her to bring Elaria before they departed.

Senara opened the door, "Elaria? why don't you..." she paused when she saw her still asleep. But it wasn't for long, the door's creak woke her up.

"Wake up Princess, they're waiting for us down there."

Elaria sat up, she rubbed her eyes, "Wai..., what?"

"It's time, we're leaving for Zevaragrad, and you've slept through the morning meal, the servants came but you didn't answer," Senara said as she slightly closed the door behind her, "What happened? You never sleep for this long."

"I had a strange dream..., it woke me up early, before twilight..., I went outside for fresh air and..., then came back..., and I dozed off," Elaria answered as she pushed her blanket and got out of her bed.

"What dream...? ok nevermind, WERE LATE. Hurry up get dressed, I'm waiting outside."

Senara stood outside waiting for her, Elaria walked out, both of them hurried down toward the courtyard.

Prince Xaolin and Princess Maria along with the envoy and the soldiers stood in the courtyard waiting for them, "You've slept well," she said with a smile as they both approached.

"I'm sorry your majesty..., I..."

"It's fine, don't worry," Maria interrupted, her tone warm, as Elaria was about to apologize.

The envoy rolled his eyes, he then stepped toward the carriage and sat in, the soldier shut the door.

The second one was brought, Elaria looked at it and then at Senara with curiosity, thinking why would they bring two  separate carriages for the envoy and them.

Maria understood her curiosity and smiled, "I'm going as well, it's been months since I've met mother, father and my siblings."

The both of them looked at her as she spoke, they nodded.

As they were going to mount the horses, Maria called them, "You two should also ride with me in the carriage, the journey is long and it'll get cold on the way."

They paused there, looking at each other, Senara grinned as she looked at Elaria, she smiled back.

The Prince and the princess embraced for a moment, he bid her farewell, Maria then walked toward the carriage and gestured them both to come inside as she stepped in.

Elaria and Senara joined her, the guard shut the door and slapped on the wood, the wheels rolled as the horse in front started to move, they rode off now from the palace, now another part of the journey was about to begin for the both of them, now riding with a stranger they'd met just few days ago.

**Fort Graywatch, two and a half Months after the Battle of the Red river, 42th Fyrmont 1701 AC**

The surroundings hid under the blanket of white, the blizzard slowed down as dawn welcomed the morning. The sky covered by thick clouds. Cold wind blew across the forest near the fort, in it's peak, the intense cold could freeze the limbs if one roamed around without any warm cloak or covered themselves properly, but in these day they were not in their peak, as winter was slowly starting to bid it's farewell.

The gates creaked as they were pushed opened by the guards, wheels rolled as the horses dragged the carts inside, filled with barrels of wheat, bread and some other food supplies they had brought from the nearest city, enough to feed the garrison for the next month. The rider dismounted the horse, a parchment in his grip as he walked toward Commander Miron who stood at the door of the main hall. Eyes sharp, his face painted by the scars of the battles he'd fought, his dark hair with a hint of silver linings, he stared at the young approach him.

"Commander," he bowed, with one hand curled into a fist on his chest, "We've brought supplies for the garrison."

"How much did he ask this time?" Miron asked the young man, his voice deep and unshaken by the cold as he stared at the cart that was being unloaded.

"Fifty gold coins, commander," the boy answered, as he straightened.

"Last time it was forty, he's asked more this time."

"Yes commander, I've asked him to lower it a bit, he was asking sixty otherwise."

Miron's jaw tightened for a moment then relaxed, he took a breath, "This knuckle head sure takes advantage of someone's situation, he knows Grimwood is the closest city to us, if we bring in supplies from any other place it'll take us more time...," he paused, "anyways take em' in."

The boy bowed, with his fist on chest, "Yes commander," he turned around toward the cart, his voice loud, "BRING HER IN."

The wheels rolled as they dragged the carts toward the storage house. 

As soon as they were about to close the gates, they saw a figure appear from the mist, hooves thumping against the ground, his cloak flapped as he rode ahead, it was a rider, a scout who just brought news.

The guard on the tower saw him and cried, "RIDER APPROACHING..."

Miron, as he was just about to head inside, heard this and turned around again toward the gate, the scout entered the gates, his heart racing, he caught his breath as he dismounted his horse. He quickly walked toward Miron, bowed his head, "Commander..., western raiders..., smoke riders, again attacked a village nearby," his tone nervous," they took all their food and valuables, left none breathing, also they've burnt their houses along with it." 

Miron's brows furrowed, "I thought we'd gotten rid of them for good since we attacked that column few weeks ago," he gestured with his hands, "And how are they getting pass the borders? Is the guard sleeping?"

As Miron said this, a few more riders arrived, they've entered the gates with the same expression of tension on their faces.

"Commander..., most of them were caught as you know very well, they disguise themselves, as merchants, traders, and some of them even use the mountain steppes to cross."

Another one of the riders approached, "Commander," he bowed his head, "We've found their hideout, it's the Serpent's Nest."

"But that's mostly swamps and jungles there, only a few villages on eastern side of the opening."

"We sent some of the scouts to investigate...," he paused, and swallowed, "but some of them didn't return, when we saw them enter the Nest, I sent some of the men after them, they saw a base right at the heart of that cursed place."

"So..., they've dug deep into our lands...," Miron clenched his fists, "this means the Vargoth have sent their vanguard, not to simply raid our lands, but to gather information about the area."

The scouts nodded. 

Miron looked at his accomplice, "Bring me a parchment and a quill, we must inform his Majesty of the current situation near the borders."

The accomplice nodded and ran inside, a few moments later he came out with the stamp,a parchment, quill and an inkwell.

Miron took them from the boy, he approached a small table, he didn't sit, he straightened the parchment, dipped the quill in the inkwell and started writing:

> To King Theron Zevaran, Your majesty, the situation at the western border is worsening as the vargoth have infiltrated the borders, their elite assassins the smoke riders have dug into our lands and made a stronghold at the heart of the Serpent's Nest. They raid villages as we speak, I fear if we don't stop them, they'll march further deep into Zevaria. I humbly request Your Majesty to give attention toward this matter.
>                                                -Commander Miron, Fort Greywatch

Miron blew on it to dry the ink, he then folded the parchment, and put his stamp on it. "Lucas...," he called the name of the rider who he usually sent to nearby forts and castles to convey his messages, the man approached, Miron handed him the letter, "Ride to the Capital, get this message to the King, take the fastest horse, change it if needed from any garrison on the way." The rider bowed as he took the letter.

"But Commander..., we can also send a pigeon," the accomplice said.

"Yes..., we can, it'll reach there fast but you see the snow outside, we can't be sure the bird will survive it on the way. If it doesn't reach there?" A moment of silence as no one answered.
"The message won't reach the Capital, a rider is the best we can do."

The accomplice nodded, "Yes..., commander."

Miron gestured the rider to go with his hand. He rushed toward his horse, one hand on the parchment stuck tightly against his ribs and the other swinging in the air as he scampered through the yar , fixed his foot in the saddle and then swung on his mount. Lucas looked at Miron, both of them nodded, he then whipped the reins. The horse neighed and bolted off, it's hooves echoed in the hush outside the castle as it runs, Miron stares at him when he leaves the gates and then disappears among the mist. _God help us, God help us all_.

**Three days later, 3rd Glacivar 1701 AC**


The trees of Blackvine forest were white in snow, their branches dry and empty, not a sign of green on them, instead the dirt road was covered with them and white. The clouds weren't thick that day so the light did came through but pale. The wind wasn't blowing so the cold was not that much affecting, it was ideal to roam out and enjoy the snowy day. The dried leaves lying on the road crackled under the hooves of the horses as they stepped on them. 

Eran held the rein of his mount as he rode ahead, Torren on his side, both of them eager to hunt down a wild themselves today. Just ahead Arlen rode, he pushed his hair back with an expression of confidence on his face, Julian by his side, looking at him as he played with his hair. 

"You sure do look certain you'll take down a white stag today."

"Yes," Arlen looked at Julian, with a grin on his face, "It won't escape my bolts today, I won't let it."

Julian nodded his eyes , a smile on his face as he slightly shook his head.

Eran watched them from behind, _Not if I take it down first_. His gripped tightened on the rein, as he smiled at his brother.

Torren looked at Eran, he leaned toward him, voice soft, "It's your first time, coming to hunt yourself, before you'd ride and just watch Arlen and Darius play."

Eran grinned as he leant toward Torren, "But today I'll play and they'll watch," his voice just loud enough for Torren to hear.

Infront of them all Theron rode with Darius alongside, the royal guard, in their violet and golden cloaks rode, along side them and behind where Eran was riding as well.

Eran could hear his father and Darius speaking but couldn't get what, as they weren't loud enough for all of them to hear. He looked around for any movement, as they rode ahead toward the spot they would dismount. Eran took out his bow, eager to shoot anything that moves before his brothers and father.

Julian stared at him while he took it out, with a smirk on his face, "Try not to shoot one of our own guards, we better not return with wounded soldiers instead of prey."

Arlen grinned as he looked at Julian, he could tell he was joking from his warm tone.

Eran didn't look at him, he took out an arrow from the bag, his tone sarcastic, "My aim is better than yours, scroll face, atleast I can draw it without my hands shaking."

Arlen laughed, his body jerked as he tried to not let it out, his hand covered his mouth, as he looked at Julian, Eran's answer did embarrass him a bit. Torren also grinned, Theron at front also gave a smile but his eyes were locked on the road ahead. Darius didn't flinch.

Julian's lips tightened as his eyes met Arlen's who laughed while he looked at him, he tilted his head slightly as Arlen turned to front shaking his head, his mouth wide with a smile.

Something moved from behind the bushes, it was caught by Eran's gaze, he pulled the rein of his horse to halt it. Torren looked at him he also pulled the rein and his horse stopped, he asked "What happened?"

Eran leant toward him, "I saw something move."

The rest of them also stopped there. Eran leant forward, swung his leg off the mount, his boots crashed against the ground as he got off. Something was there indeed, it raised it ears as it heard the sound.

Julian, whispered, "QUIET..., or you'll scare it away."

Eran gestured with hand, approving his suggestion. As he stepped forward his foot landed on a small trinket, it snapped into two, the figure hiding behind the bush galloped away, it was a white stag. Eran saw it run away, he also sprinted behind it. 

Arlen also swung himself off his horse, he took out his bow and was about to run behind his brother until Theron stopped him, "No..., stay behind, let him go and show what he can do."

Arlen nodded, but he still walked ahead after his brother.

The stag pierced through the woods, it's hooves echoed in the calm of the forest. Not too far behind him followed Eran, as fast as his legs could take him, he nocked the arrow as he ran but didn't draw it yet, he kept following the stag waiting to get the right aim.

Arlen, saw the stag disappear into the woods and also Eran after him, there was mist in the air as well, that blinded the sight of them when they got a little far, he also followed after.

Eran now drew his arrow, and just when the stag slowed down to take a turn he aimed and loosened it while he was still running. The arrow hissed through the air and struck the stag on it's thigh, slowing it down. It shrieked with pain as blood spilt and after running a few meters ahead it collapsed down on it's leg. Eran followed him, he also stopped near the stag just a few feet away, he bent down, his palms resting on his knees as he caught his breath.

He then straightened, and nocked another arrow, Arlen had also came close who was running after them, Eran drew the arrow and shot the stag, leaving it lifeless, his brother's jaw dropped when he arrived and saw Eran hunt down a white stag just on his first hunt.

He walked toward him, "You've really hunted a white stag, it took me four attempts to get one when I was your age," he said, his voice loud and his tone reflecting his pride on his younger brother, as he took Eran in his embrace, he rubbed his fingers on Eran's head, "You've proven you can be the among the best of the archers in these lands, great job," he said as Eran backed from the hug.

The royal guards along with the rest of the brother approached from behind, the King mounted on his horse. They saw the stag lying lifeless and everyone got shocked. Julian's jaw dropped as he looked at Eran and the stag, Torren's brows raised, his mouth curved in aw, King Theron and Darius didn't react much except Theron gave a smile. 

He dismounted from his horse and walked toward his son, he put his hand on Eran's head, "Well done, My son, you've shown your ability well," Eran's smile widened, he turned toward Arlen, Arlen winked at him as he grinned.

The rest of them took their shots at the prey as well as they found it, Arlen took down a couple hares, Julian and Torren also got a hare each, Darius shot down a deer, before they tied their prey with their saddles and travelled home.

Eran, smiling and his face now fresh with happiness looked at Torren as they rode along, "I told you, they'll watch and I'll play."

Torren nodded as he smiled at Eran, "I still can't believe you took the shot while running."

Eran, raised his brow for a moment as he tilted his head, "Well..., I didn't train for three years for nothing."

Torren, nodded, a feeling of aw still inside, but he was happy for his younger brother. 

For a moment all of them, Arlen, Darius, Julian forgot about the tension that had been between them all this time, they laughed and jokes as they rode toward home, in fact this warmth was temporary indeed.

***

The capital walls were covered in white with the banners hanging motionless on them. It grew a bit dark as the cloud cover thickened. The guard on the main gate bowed to the King approaching followed by his sons, smiles on their faces after the good time they had in the hunt. The road filled with noise of people, busy in their daily routine, as the King and the Princes rode on the road.

The palace gates were opened as they approached, Theron saw the pigeon master in the courtyard in his white dress, head covered by the leather cap, protecting it from the cold. He stood there waiting for the King to arrive. He bowed as they entered the courtyard.

"What is it?" Theron asked, as he dismounted his horse, followed by his sons.

The servant girl stood in the gallery, she stared at Arlen as he dismounted his horse, her eyes filled with desire and hope as she looked at him, her lips sightly widened.

Darius and Julian, murmured among themselves as they swung off their mount. They looked at the pigeon master as he stepped toward the King.

"Your Majesty," he bowed his head, "Word from the Red road, the envoy from Azlari and Princess Maria have crossed the central Dawngard lands, they'll reach Valdrek Estate soon."

Arlen looked at him as he heard about his sister also coming, a smile lit up on his face, he'll see her now, after so long.

"So they approach our borders, someone should be there to receive them," Theron raised one of his brows as he spoke, a smile on his face. He turned toward his son, "Arlen," he gestured toward him, "Ride to Valdrek Estate, the envoy will arrive there soon, maybe the day you reach there or after it, you'll be there to receive them and escort them to the Capital."

Arlen bowed, his lips widened, "Yes Father."

"Leave right away, I don't want them greeting you there."

Eran stood with Torren behind near the horses, as Arlen straightened, Eran stepped forward, "I want to come as well."

Arlen turned toward him, "It's days of travel, it'll tire you, don't worry we'll return as soon as they arrive there."

Eran furrowed his bows, "It's not a battle, that you're going into that'll put me in danger, come on, let me come with you."

Arlen looked at Theron, the King gestured with a slight smile.

"Alright," he turned toward Eran, with a smile he said, "You can come, we'll leave after the early meal."

Eran grinned, he looked at Torren, Torren smiled, tilting his head, _And I'll be reading books till you both return_. 

The girl approached, her gaze down in respect of the royalty, her voice low, "Your Majesty, the meal is ready," her eyes raised slowly as she looked at Arlen. 

The Prince nodded his gaze at his scabbard, "Great, we'll be there," he untied it from his waist and handed it over to the guard.

The girl stepped back, her head down, as they walked toward the gallery, she raised it, staring at the heir as he walked among his brothers with hope lingering in her heart.

The family once again sat together for the meal, the hall was filled with warmth after a while now. The rare moment when the brothers now sat together without bumping heads into one another. Even though that cold lingered in Darius but sometimes he would sit down at peace with Arlen during such moments.

Arlen and Eran walked together toward the horses after they had the meal, both giggled as they shared jokes. Eran now happy he'll finally ride with his brother on a longer travel instead of some hunt in the jungle. Both of them mounted their horses, followed by a dozen soldiers as well. They rode off in the cold, their cloaks flapped as their horse's hooves clashed against the ground.
