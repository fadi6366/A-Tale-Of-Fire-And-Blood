# Chapter 8 (When Two worlds meet - I)

**Twelve days later, 15th Glacivar 1701 AC**

It was a sunny morning that day, a moment of warmth as the sun showed it's face after days of cold. The city of Pinereach, its walls and builds covered in white as they were under the cloud for weeks. The city was given to the Valdreks as a reward by the Zevaran ruler, for their help in a civil war. The heart of the territory given to the Valdreks, where Dawngard and Zevarian roads crossed. Not a booming city like the Capital but still it had it's significance.

Valdrek Estate, the home of the Valdrek Family, stood tall at the heart of Pinereach, among the other builds and towers of the city. The banners flapped as the slow wind whispered. Sparrows flew over the towers, a couple even landed on the railing, staring over the city.

"Prepare the chambers, his highness will arrive soon," Jason ordered the servant, he wore a leather tunic. A young lad of the same age as Arlen, he was the son of the Valdrek lord and brother of Fredrick, who as Arlen's closest companion.

The servant bowed and walked off with the other servants. Jason looked at Fredrick who stood at the gate of the Manor, a smile on his face, and hands behind his back. He was eager to meet his friend whom he last saw when they returned from the war south.

"You sure look happy today," Jason said, as he approached beside Fredrick, wearing a fine cotton attire, soft and warm, his eyes also stared at the skyline outside the estate's gate.

"Yes..., the Prince finally visits us, I wanted to greet him at our home for a long time," Fredrick turned his head toward Jason, his eyes turned toward the ground for a moment, letting out a sigh, he added, "he doesn't visit often."

Jason nodded, his lips remained tightened but his eyes and face did reflect a slight smile. He also admired the Prince a lot and was fond of his company, "Yes...," the smile on his face slowly fainted but his expression was still the same, "And what about the envoy? And her highness, Princess Maria," he turned toward Fredrick and asked, "Any idea, when will they arrive?"

"The Prince is expected to arrive today, and them...," Fredrick replied before he paused for a moment, his brows lifted as he looked at his brother, "Maybe tomorrow or a couple days after..."

Jason briefly closed his eyes, he sighed as he opened them, "What do they want exactly?? I don't remember the Azlari sending an envoy like this to the capital, at least not in my days."

Fredrick tightened his teeth, he also knew the Azlari won't be sending a peace offering without a purpose, he raised his brow, tilting his head, Fredrick replied, "Only time will tell what waits us, you're right, they haven't sent an envoy like this for years. Perhaps they want more benefits from the trade or something else."

"Yes..., maybe."

The guards at the watch-towers on the gates of the city saw figures approach from distance. As they got closer the violet banners they were holding became clearly visible. The cloaks of the royal guard swung politely as the stallions marched toward the city gates. Both the Princes rode a black Friesians. Arlen held the rein in his one hand while the other rested on his lap. He sat straight, his gaze at the city gate and on the towers on both sides. Eran rode just beside him. The royal guard's men behind them.

The guard gestured to the boy who stood near him, the young started to beat the stick against the skin of the drum. It's voice echoed across the street.

"Inform the Lord,  the Prince has arrived," the guard cried at the one standing below, next to the tower.

The man nodded and rushed toward the manor, one of hands on the sheath of his blade and the other swung as he sprinted across the streets.

Both of the brothers saw the man approach, he stopped just in front of the steps that led to the gate of the Manor. Bowing his head, he placed his fist on his chest, he met Jason's gaze and said, "My lord, they are here."

Both of them looked at each other, Fredrick gestured Jason to go inside and tell the servants to  make preparations, Jason nodded and walked inside.

The gates were opened, the Princes and the guards rode in. Arlen looked around as he passed through, nothing much had changed since he last came here, the corner of his lips curved as he saw the Manor approaching ahead.

Eran had never been to Pinereach before, the beauty of the city fascinated him. Even though it was nothing like the Capital but still had it's charm. The dark blue banners of the Valdreks rose high in the air, the white leopard's eyes glowed on them as it stared at the one who looked at them.

Arlen and Fredrick met each other's gaze as they approached in front of the Manor. Arlen swung off his horse, his mouth widened to a grin, seeing his friend after months. 

"So..., the Prince finally has the time to visit," Fredrick said, a warm smile on his face as he walked climbed down the steps.

"Would have visited sooner, if you weren't this far away," Arlen replied as he walked toward Fredrick.

Both of them wrapped their arms around the other, a warm embrace between the two brothers, even though they didn't share the same blood.

"It's good to see you, your highness," Fredrick said, he tightened his arms.

"Well...," Arlen felt his ribs being squeezed, his voice struggled to come out under Fredrick's strong grip, he continued, "You don't..., have to call me that every time, and... you're squeezing me too tight."

Eran walked in from behind, in a joking tone he said, " We would like him to be breathing when we return home," a smile on his face.

Fredrick let go at last, and Arlen sucked in a breath as he grinned, both of them giggled at Eran's remark.

"Don't worry...," Fredrick gripped Arlen's shoulder with his thumb and finger, "Your brother is in safe hands here."

Eran closed in and they both hugged as well, Jason came out from behind,  he also was happy to see the Princes. He clapped his hand with Arlen's and they both hug, following one with Eran as well. The group then walked in. Fredrick's parents greeted both the Princes with warm courtesy, though Arlen's attention lingered more on Fredrick, his friend whom he met after months.

**Two days later, 17th Glacivar 1701 AC**

The Red road lied between the tree lines, white spread along. The scent of the cold winter and dry wood filled up the path. The walls and towers of Pinereach could be seen from a distance, but not clearly as the mist rose once again as clouds cloaked over, the sun was pale that day. It was colder that day, more than when Arlen and Eran arrived two days earlier. 

The wooden wheels of both the carriages creaked as they moved on the road. Horse hooves also echoed as they strode toward the city. Elaria sat by the small window in the carriage, staring at the trees outside and plains beyond them. She had her chin rest on her curled fingers, as she stared at the scenery among the mist. _This place would look more beautiful in spring or summer days, without the mist._ She had a thing for nature, growing up she would sit at a balcony looking at the trees outside, maybe even ride out with her father and gaze at the plains.

Beside her sat Senara, she gazed at Maria who sat just opposite to Elaria. She also stared outside the window, waiting for the long travel to end. Eager to arrive at her home, but they had to stop at Pinereach. One last stop before the road to Zevaragrad.

Maria looked at Elaria who was lost in her thoughts, and the view outside. She turned her eyes outside before breaking the silence, "You seem to miss the green outside," she asked, her voice soft and low.

Elaria didn't look at Maria, nor did she move her hand, she replied, "I'm wondering how it all would look without the snow covering it," her tone faint, weeks of being on the road did got the best of her.

"They sure are...," Maria turned her stare at Elaria, with a soft smile on her face she continued, "Spring will be here soon, then you'll see their true colors."

Elaria straightened as she met Maria's gaze, she curiously asked, "You get tired..., don't you? I mean travelling to your home and then back,..." her brows lifted slightly in curiosity as she continued, "You would spend most of your time on road."

Maria let out a sigh, she replied, "I don't go home very often, the last time I came here was three summers ago...," she looked toward the window, "When my father and brothers went down south..., to fight the Nalandians."

Senara tightened her lips before letting them loose to speak, she asked curiously, "So..., how long do you stay at home then?"

Maria looked at her, she tilted her head slightly, her eyes looked down for a moment before staring back at Senara, "A couple months at most, sometimes even just one."

_All this travel for staying just a month?_ Elaria's brows furrowed as she heard her answer, she didn't felt comfortable for the Princess. "Then why marry to a land this far from your home?" she asked, her tone showed her concern.

She licked her lips, and swallowed before she answered, "Sometimes..., its not our choice, we do what the state needs," she looked at Elaria, "I was married to Xaolin for a treaty signed between the Zevarans and the Valmyrs at that time."

"What treaty?"

"You see, there wasn't always peace between the Zevarans and Dawngard rulers."

"What happened?"

"The Valmyrs rebelled against the throne, the entire Dawngard united against the King. When it was all over, they decided that every generation a Zevaran Princess will marry a Dawngard Prince, and when I grew up, it was my turn to continue that," her tone reflected her despair, but she now grew fond of the Prince after the years she spent in the vow.

"But why did the Dawngard help the Zevarans in the war south?"

"You know about it?"

"We heard about it from a merchant, during our stay at the Centaki."

"Oh..., that explains it..., well the two act as one when something from outside threatens."

Elaria nodded, she was not the only one who was sent away from home just because the state required it. Even though these lands were once her mother's, they were still stranger to her.

For a while none of them spoke.

Senara broke the silence, her voice a bit loud this time but not enough for the guards outside to hear, "So you don't have any kids? It's been years since you've married right?"

Elaria looked at her, irritated by her question, her eyes squinted.

Maria's eyes almost filled up, but she swallowed it back, "I had a son..., he died when he was just two, the medics said it was a sickness he had since he was born," she paused then said, "we tried everything, called in the best ones in the lands..., but he closed his eyes from this realm."

Both of them were shaken from inside after about her child's death.

Elaria leant forward, she put her hand on Maria's lap, "I'm..., sorry..., to hear that."

Maria put her hand on Elaria's, "It's fine, I've learnt to live with it now. With what life throws at me."

Senara lowered her gaze, _Why did I ask her this? I just salted her wounds._

None of them spoke, Maria turned her gaze outside the window, Elaria kept her stare at the Princess. _She's been through a lot, guess we both have something in common_. She turned toward the window, placing her chin on her curled fingers again. _Loss..., I lost my mother, and she lost her only child._

The wheels creaked as they rode on, the city was now closer. The guards standing on the watch-towers could be seen, not clearly, as dull figures but could be seen. The girl from halfway across the world was now about to meet the Prince she had been hearing stories about on her way to these lands. Their paths were now finally about to cross.  

***

Back at the Capital, the norms of life continued as usual. Though the absence of Arlen and Eran did make the palace feel a bit empty and hollow for some, but not for all. Outside in the city the noise of the market, people bargaining about the cost, some friends gathered at the corner of the street laughing at jokes, filled the air. The training grounds were also filled with echoes of blades clashing as the soldiers drilled.

Inside the palace, Helene the servant girl stood by the pillar, staring at the empty courtyard. She just had done cleaning up the floors of the gallery and dusting the rooms of the Princes. _When will the Prince return? It's been days since they left. How far is the Valdrek estate from here?_ She had the flame for Arlen in her heart since the first time she saw him after she came to the palace. Everyday she would wake up with hope lingering in her heart, but end her day with a realization that he's a Prince after all, with all the choices he could have in the world, why would he notice a nobody like her?

Lilly, her friend, another young girl who served at the palace was walking across the gallery. She saw Helene standing alone and walked toward her, her voice friendly and low, she asked, "You're thinking about him again, aren't you?"

Helene looked at Lilly, a bit of a disappointment in her voice, she replied, "Does it even matter? If I think about him or not, he won't see me the way I do. Why would a Prince like a servant like me?"

Lilly softly took Helene's hand in her's, as if she was trying to give her hope, she said, "He will...," she put her second hand on Helene's, she added "Maybe not now, but some day he will see it, and I assure you, he will feel the same, for a beautiful girl who has been waiting for him since she placed foot in the palace."

Helene pulled her hand back, she turned toward the empty yard, leaning on the pillar, she answered, "He doesn't even bother look at me, you say he'll feel the same."

Lilly, put her hand on Helene's back, "He will..., even if he's high born, love doesn't see boundaries, you just wait and don't get upset."

Helene didn't answer her, she stared at the gate of the palace, the pheonix carved into the wood, it's flaming wings spread wide. _I hope she's right_.

Lilly then walked away after a moment of silence between the two, her shoes echoed in the quiet. Wind brushed Helene's hair on her face as she stood there in silence.

Stick clashed against the drum as the carriages surrounded by soldiers on their mounts approached. The gates of Pinereach were pushed opened by the guards. The bell was also rung, alerting the ones in the manor as well. The wooden body of the carriage creaked as they rolled, carrying them across the gates. 

Horse hooves echoed as they strode in, the guards meeting the gaze of the ones that stood at the door. They nodded at each other. Azlari guards' were a bit different and cold, didn't bother give an eye to the Zevaran soldiers at duty, kept their gaze ahead as they entered the city.

Arlen sat in his room, he rubbed a small cloth over the blade of his sword, something he did when alone in his room or had nothing to do, apart from going outside and wandering. A knock on the door echoed in the quiet. He didn't look at it just asked, "Yes...? What is it?"

The door creaked as Eran pushed it open, he stepped in softly. Arlen looked up and saw his brother, he put the cloth aside on the table.

"They have arrived, the envoy and our sister," Eran said, urgency reflected in his tone, "Come on...," he gestured with his head, hand still on the door handle.

Arlen nodded, his lips tight but curved slightly at his brother. He then put on his boots and his sword in the sheath. He walked out of the room and rubbed his fingers in Eran's hair, he said, "So we finally Maria after months," happiness and warmth in his voice.

Eran smiled as they walked outside toward the yard.

Fredrick stood at the gate, his arms crossed, gaze at front, looking at them approach. He looked back to see Jason walk toward him, with Arlen and Eran just behind.

"I thought you'd fallen asleep, would've had to greet them myself," Fredrick looked at Arlen as he rushed toward him.

"You think I'll let my sister arrive without seeing me to greet her?" Arlen answered as his brows curved and lips widened for a smile.

Fredrick grinned and clapped his palm against Arlen's. They then stood and watched the caravan approach.

The horses slowed down and halted just few meters away from the steps that entered the gate of the Manor. They moved away from the road to make way for the carriages. It slowed down and the rider sitting at the horse who pulled turned it so the door opens toward the Prince who stood at the door.

The guard opened the door and the envoy stepped out, wearing the light coloured cloak over his warm tweed tunic. He looked at Arlen as he stepped down to greet the guest.

Arlen wrapped his arm around the envoy formally, as he brought his other forward after letting go, for a handshake. The envoy's lips curved as he shook Arlen's hand, "You must be the heir to the Zevarian throne, Prince Arlen."

Arlen smiled as he answered, "And you must be Lord Azekial the envoy King Orestane sent."

"We've heard a lot about you while traveling here, it's an honour meeting you in person," Azekial answered with a smile on his face, although not genuine but formal.

Arlen nodded in gratitude, he gestured with his hand toward the gate of the Manor, "Come, let yourself rest, you might be tired after weeks on the road."

The envoy nodded and smiled as he stepped toward the gate, Fredrick, Jason and Eran greeted him before he walked in. Across the yard stood William Fredrick, the father of Fredrick and Jason, along with his wife Olivia Fredrick. They welcomed the envoy and expressed to feel honoured to have gotten the opportunity.

Arlen looked toward the second carriage as it stopped, the door opened and Maria stepped out, Arlen's mouth widened as he saw her, he opened his arms as he walked toward her, "Sister...," he said.

Maria looked at him and a grin lit up her face, she also stepped toward him with her arms open, "Brother...?" the brother and sister embraced. It was a warm hug, that resonated both of their happiness after meeting each other this much long time.

"You've finally gotten the time to visit," Arlen said softly as they both let go.

"You've grown bigger since the last time I was here," Maria added.

"You're still the same," he replied in a teasing tone.

Maria then moved ahead and now Eran ran toward her, hugging her as tight as he could.

"Owww..., look who's come to receive his sister," Maria said, her eyes close as she hugged her little brother, she rubbed her hair as they let go politely, "You've grown up as well," she said, her eyes caught the bow that was tied to Eran's back, Maria's lips opened to a grin, "Would you look at that, you're becoming an archer now."

"Yes..., I wanted to make sure you arrive home safe," Eran answered, his voice soft and a rigid tone.

All of them burst open for a brief giggle. 

Jason with his arms crossed and one hand just near his chin, "Alright let your sister come inside, she needs to rest after travelling for long."

They all smiled at Eran's remark. Maria walked toward the gate, Fredrick and Jason welcomed her with respect, the same way they would have done if they had an elder sister and she'd come.

Arlen looked at the carriage as he heard the sound of someone else stepping out as well, eyes widened as his gaze stuck on Elaria as she came out of the carriage. He saw her bright face, sharp, bright eyes seemed tired, her silky hair brushed over her forehead as she stepped out, although just long enough to reach her neck. His heartbeat seemed it stopped for a moment. His mouth opened slightly but didn't say anything, stunned in awe. _Damn, she's beautiful_. His heart raced as his throat seemed it ran dry. When she looked up he quickly got himself together to not look strange.

Elaria looked at him, already staring at her, _Oh..., so he's the prince they tell stories about_. She looked at him, in admiration, the slight scar on his cheek bone, his hair pushed back on one side. _He sure does looks like an heir_. 

Both of them locked gaze for a few moments, Arlen felt as if the world had stopped around him, he forgot about why he was there for a moment, she looked different than any lady he'd seen. Arlen had seen many pretty girls but she was different, Elaria had caught his eye and maybe heart as well. Elaria on the other hand, though didn't had the similar reaction but a feeling of admiration did run through her. The Prince's looks did compliment the stories she had heard on the way.

Senara then stepped out of the carriage "Finally..., that was some voyage," she whispered as she came close to Elaria. Elaria nodded and they both walked toward the gate.

Arlen looked at her with a sharp gaze, lowering it then when of them passed beside him to the gate. He then raised it toward Elaria as she walked.
Fredrick and Jason saw him staring at her, when Arlen looked at him, they smiled at him, slighlty shaking heads.

Arlen tightened his lips, his brows furrowed as he titled his head. He then moved inside as well.

Fredrick teased him, Jason joined as well. Eran grinned but didn't spoke, just saw them as they all walked across the yard. Fredrick's parents greeted the guests.

***

While the Prince was greeting the guests with his brother and friends, on the other side of the lands was something else that no one had any clue about. An evil that had been quiet for centuries even millennia. One that dated back to even before the humans. Now was rising.

The young man sat on a man, his eyes closed, he had his arms straightened and hands resting on his knees. Legs crossed, his back straight. The room was dark, no light passed through any window or opening as he had them closed, just some candles that were placed in front him. To someone outside it seemed he was meditating but that was not the case. He was seeing something else, a vision.

He stood in a stone chamber, with blood spilt everywhere, fresh as just recently someone was cut down. The moonlight coming from the opening, red and ominous. A black tunic covered his body, although bare-footed. The cold floor sent chills in his body. His eyes stared at the altar where the light was falling on.

He felt a strong rush across his body as wind started to blow and smoke appeared in front of him.  The blood on the floor pushed away as it rose. The chill suddenly turned into a warm feeling. At it's centre a figure emerged, the smoke circling around it, covering the entire body. It was difficult to see what was it, or who was it. Only a dark voice came from the smoke, and a pair of red glowing eyes flashed. 

The man asked the figure, "What do you want? Why summon me?" his jaw tightened, unrest on his face, as he was busy doing his work when the figure summoned him.

The figure's eyes glowed brighter as it answered, tone deep and dark, "The wheel of destiny..., completes it's round..., the moment nears..."

His brows furrowed, he glared at the figure as he asked, "Now? But you said we still have more time."

The figure let out what seemed a deep breath, it's eyes blinked before brightening again, it replied, "The next descendants..., of the flame bringer..., have been chosen..., I..., can sense h...,them can feel..., the energy awakening..."

"Who are they?"

"I cannot see..., but I feel them, the flame..., it lives..."

"Some *** you are..., if don't see who's wielding the power," he taunted, in a sarcastic tone, his lips curved slightly for a smile.

The figure rose higher, the glow from it's eyes brightened, it said, "Don't dare..., question me boy..., If you want..., the world in your grasp..., you do as I command," the smoke expanded toward the man, almost touching his face, sending a shiver down his body, "You..., and I are one, bound together."

The man's jaw tightened, he lowered his head, he uttered in a low voice, "Yes...," he paused for a moment, lowering his gaze, "Master."

The figure backed off now, on his altar, "We have to find the chosen..., before he discovers the power he carries..., and then... we'll take his life..., and then" his voice grew louder, "NO ONE...!!!, will stop us..., from conquering the world..., darkness will spread across these lands... ONCE AGAIN!!!"

He raised his head and smiled, looking at the figure circled the room and continued to talk about his plans. The room then grew dark as the smoke started to circle more quickly, it shrunk and then suddenly spread out before vanishing. The man's body felt a chill run across it. He looked at the red moon above and swallowed.

He opened his eyes and raised his head, looking at the door of the room he sat in. Racing, as he woke up from the vision, his heart now steadied slowly. His fingers curled into fists. _I'll find them..., and I'll finish them myself..._
