# Chapter 6 (The Path Ahead)


The surroundings covered in mist made it hard to look around, cold wind blew across, blood was spilt everywhere. Screams of people could be heard as if they were right beside, but he couldn't see anyone there. Carts upside down, houses burnt down, Arlen walked slowly as he tried to find his way out, feet bare, his body covered by a white torn tunic, eyes squinted. His head felt heavy, it seemed he would fade out soon. He saw burnt banners but he couldn't recognize them.

"Fred??, Commander Trifon??, Darius..., FATHER..., ANYONE??" he cried as his heart raced in fear. All of a sudden the mist cleared and the cold wind stopped, he didn't understand what was happening. He swallowed, eyes widened as he looked around, the screams and cries slowly echoed away, now an uncomforting silence across the plundered town he stood in.

Footsteps echoed, breaking the silence, slow but in a rhythm. Arlen's vision hazed for a moment, as a figure approached in front of him, as his vision cleared his eyes stuck wide open, chills ran over his body, his jaw dropped in the horror of the sight.

It was no one but himself, Arlen, eyes wide open, an evil grin on his mouth, skin pale, wearing a black leather armour, as he dragged a young boy along from his collar. Arlen looked at the boy, he recognized him, the same boy he killed in front of his mother when he raided the villages in the war. He started to tremble with fear, "Who..., who are you?" he cried.

The dark version of himself, he was looking at took out the dagger, he leaned as he dragged the boy in front.

Arlen, his hand raised toward the ghost, "NOOOO.....," he shouted, as the figure splashed the blade against the throat of the boy, blood splattered from the cut, it ran out and flowed toward Arlen's feet, he felt it's warmth as it touched his skin, Arlen quickly moved a couple steps back.

The ghost then stood up, looking at Arlen, the grin still on his face as he started chanting, "Murderer..., murderer..., murderer...," in a sinister tone. 

More figures approached, surrounding Arlen, each one of them had the same words on their tongue, "Murderer..., Murderer..." in a rhythm.

Arlen stepped back a few paces, he collided with one of them, and fell on his hand, as he looked back he saw a woman, it was the mother in front of whom he slayed a boy and a girl, who looked him in the eye.

"You... slaughtered... innocents... now... you... speak... of mercy..., HYPOCRITE, HYPOCRITE...," she chanted.

Arlen was now surrounded by the ghosts who chanted and moved toward him. He lowered his head covering it with his hands, he screamed "NOOOO..."

His eyes opened as he sat up, pushing the blanket, his eyes wide open, throat dry, his chest seemed it was burning, like someone ignited a fire but inside his ribs. Heart raced as he put his hand on his chest as he swallowed. _What's that burn? It feels like someone's roasting my lungs_. He looked at the glass window, the sky was dark, pale moonlight fell on the trees, as the leaves rustled outside his window, he closed his eyes, face upward as he took a breath, he then opened them as he looked at the ceiling, calming down after a slight relief of realizing it was just a dream. 

He covered his eyes with his palms, as he rested on them, _What did I do..._.

**The next day...**

The sand shores were lit up by the morning light, the gulls screeched, leaves on the the beach-trees rustled as the cold wind blew along. The silence at the harbour slowly turned into loud cries and murmurs of people, the inn halls also filled up as voyagers walked in for their morning meal. Elaria rubbed her eyes as she woke up, stretched her arms looking out the window of the room. Her mouth widened, her hand covering it as she yawned, eyes squint, her mind slowly waking up to the life going on.

Senara walked in looking at Elaria, "Wake up princess, we have a long journey ahead," in a playful tone.

Elaria pushed the blanket aside as she jumped out of her bed, "When do we leave?" voice lazy, her eyes still half closed as she fought to widen them.

"Right after the captain has his morning meal, come on, he'll be up quick."

"Wait outside, I'll get dressed."

Senara nodded, she walked out, shutting the door behind her. She stood outside waiting to Elaria, she walked just a few moments later, "Come on..., let's have our meal, after that it's just sea-food again for the next few days," Senara said as both of them walked toward the inn hall. 

"What I can you serve you my ladies??" the waitron approached as both of them got seated. Senara ordered this time, they had their meal before they bid their goodbyes to the waitron after paying him.

"He was nice guy," Senara said, as they walked out toward the ship, their bags strapped to them.

"Sure he was..., you don't find that often these days," Elaria answered, her voice low but just enough for Senara to hear.

"HOIST THE ANCHOR...," the captain ordered after everyone was onboard, the boys raised it up, pushing the lever, metal chained clanked as it slowly came up. The crewman blew the trumpet, voice echoed across the port, signalling the vessel now departing after a day long break at the island.

"How long will it take now sir?" Elaria asked the captain as she approached.

"Seven days to the most, child, if the storms don' slow us down maybe five or even four, in the dragon's bay it's ca'lm most of the time, let's hope it remai'ns the same for us," the captain answered his gaze on the map in his hands.

The ship slowly left the harbour, the wood creaked as the crewmen rowed, "PORT...," the second in command shouted as they steered it toward the Bay of the Dragon, now entering the waters that truly came in the Zevarian territory, Elaria and Senara stood at the front deck, gazing at the horizon.

Senara broke brief silence, "And here we go, off to the lands we know nothing off, the Prime Advisor's daughter and loud open mouth best friend," she giggled and patted on Elaria's back, "You look worried," she said as she looked at her face.

"No, I'm just wondering..., what might wait us there, how will be the people there..., were going to live among the royal family of the most powerful kingdom in the world, how will they be...," Elaria answered, voice low.

"I'm sure they'll know the daughter of the Azlari Prime Advisor has half Zevarian blood, and they'll welcome you," Senara's tone confident about what she said.

Elaria gave a slight smile, "Let's hope for the best," voice low, her gaze at the horizon. _What if they don't accept us, or send us back, what will father say if I fail?? What will the king say to father if I don't succeed_. 

As wind blew, their hair brushed on their faces, eyes squinted from the breeze, they looked at each other and smiled, knowing it was the beginning of the next part of their journey.

**At Zevaragrad...**

The arrow hissed through the air and struck the centre of the target, a smile ran over Eran's smile, he felt now he's getting it right. He nocked and drew another one, bringing it close to his jaw, leather glove covering his three fingers, one eye closed, focused on the target as he loosened it. The arrow flew quick, piercing the air and struck along side the previous one he shot, he smiled again, this time he gazed at it for bit longer.

He looked at the gallery as he heard footsteps, it was Arlen, who had just woken up, his face showing exactly what felt after the dream he had last night. 
Eran looked at him as he came to the yard, as he nocked another arrow, "So...," he said as he drew it, "You had that dream again," his voice warm, soft tone, as he loosened and it struck the target just half an inch from the centre.

"They get worse everytime," Arlen answered as let out a sigh, voice low.

"Perhaps, you should stop thinking about it too much, you are not that kind of a man anymore," Eran said, as he loosened another arrow.

"I try to but..., everytime I go to sleep or I'm just sitting trying to relax, that woman's face comes in my mind, the way she looked at me after I butchered her children, and then her as well," Arlen's brow furrowed as he said, he sat down on the steps.

Eran placed his bow down before he stepped toward Arlen, and sat down beside him, " You're only punishing yourself for something no one even cares about, father was happy, when you returned home from south, he even announced you heir," he said, looking at Arlen, and placed his hand around his shoulders.

"Look...," Arlen turned toward Eran, "I know it was a war, but..., atleast...," he looked down," I shouldn't have ordered those raids on innocent people, I tried to follow my father and Darius' steps, but now I realize I was wrong..., they are wrong..., about blindly shedding blood."

"Well..., you've seen it atleast..., that you were wrong. Many don't," Eran said, "And that's why you were not happy when Darius went south to kill all of those people."

"Yes, I've seen it myself, what war does if you drag in innocents as well, it's understood when you slay those mercilessly who stand in front of you with blade and bow in hand, but...," Arlen took a breath, "Those who are away from it, don't deserve to be slaughtered like sheep." 

"You've seen it..., and you've decided not to do it again," Eran stood up and stepped in front of Arlen, "You cannot change what is already been done, you can only fix it by not doing it again, and also don't let it haunt you for no reason, that happened months ago, and you're not the same person anymore," Eran said as they both looked into each others' eyes. 

Arlen smiled as he heard his brother say words that seemed wiser than his age, he knew Eran might be young but sometimes he seemed wiser than his age, he stood up, "Alright...," he gave a light pat on Eran's shoulder, "Let's go have breakfast, I wonder what they've prepared today," he said as they both climbed the steps and walked in the gallery toward the hall.

"Meat of the red dear maybe...," Eran said with a smile, voice excited.

"Yes, maybe something even better...," Arlen replied in a playful tone.

The both brothers walked chattering about what could be prepared for them, their voice faded as they walked ahead.

**Six days later..., 3rd Frostveil, 1700 AC**

The harbour was filled with the echoes of ship-horns and murmurs of people arriving and some departing, the high walls of the city behind casting shadow over as the sun was setting slowly behind them, a layer of white covered the surrounding as now winter had announced itself.

A local roamed around the harbour, as he waited for the time of his ship to departure, _How much do I have to wait?... I'm finally going home, my children will be waiting for me..., it's been four months_ a slight smile on his face, as he thought about his family. He let out a mist, his gaze paused at the horizon for a moment, a ship approaching from a far.

"They are here...," another man approached him and said.

"Who?"

"When I left Shinobi a few days prior to this one, I heard about the Azlari king sending an envoy to Zevaria," he answered, letting out a breath.

"I don't remember the Azlari's ever reaching out for peace or anything, except for trade only, since they took the Shinobi Islands from the Zevarans," the man said, his tone curious.

"The Azlari king is a cunning snitch, if he's sent someone as a peace gesture, it might be something else as well," his voice deepened as he answered.

"How do you know him?"

"I've been travelling between the two lands for years, old friend, I met the King quiet a few times now, when he roamed around the market, to buy some goods, you can see it on his face, and trust me, I've been through enough to judge a man by lookin' at one."

"Let's hope whatever's that ship bringin' to us, it's for the better."

His friend nodded, "Yes..., let's hope."

The ship approached the harbour, Elaria stood on the deck, she looked at the city walls of Dragonweil, beyond the harbour, and the high towers risen up in the sky, as the sun started to sink behind them. The shores of dawngard, spread from the sides of the harbour, treeline along them. Fishermen tying the ropes of their boats with the pier, after returning from a long day among the waters. 

The ship docked at the harbour, anchor was lowered, they stepped off the ship, Elaria paid the captain as she and Senara along with the envoy and some Azlari soldiers now walked toward the Dawngard troops who were there to take to the palace.

Senara leaned slightly toward Elaria, she whispered, "I like their cloaks, the dragon looks good doesn't it."

Elaria gave a slight smile, "Yes, it does, but this doesn't seem like Zevaria, they have the Pheonix as the sigil not dragon."

The commander heard Elaria's whisper as she showed concern about the sigil, "You're right Me' lady, it's not Zevaria, we're the soldiers of Dawngard, an ally state of the Zevarans, you can take it as an extended arm of Zevaria."

"Then why weren't we brought to the shores of Zevaria," the envoy looked at the captain, tone hard.

"Your highness...," the commander said in a friendly tone, "There is nothing to worry about, the ideal port to land on, if you travel from bayside landing to the Capital, if you'd landed on the port in the Zevarian cities it would have taken you more days to travel, the..."

As the commander was about to continue the envoy raised his hand, interrupting him, "Fine, I got it this is the shortest path," his tone hard.

The commander's jaw tightened, yet he tried to maintain the calm on his face, "This way your highness to the palace," he gestured with his hand.

Elaria and Senara shared a gaze as they followed behind the envoy, they looked at the commander and slightly bowed, passing on a smile, he warmly gestured back at them. _How many days do we have to travel more_, Senara wondered.

They mounted on the horses brought by the Dawngard soldiers as they rode toward the palace, both of them gazed at the walls of the city as they left the port and entered the gates. Both of them unaware how much time they'll spend on this side of the world, when will they return home, or will they?

***

The gates of the palace creaked open as they approached, the roof covered in white, both of them looked around and saw the carvings of the dragon all over the walls and pillars. The Golden banners of Dawngard flapped as the wind blew, the courtyard under the shadow of the palace.

They dismounted and stepped inside the palace gate, with Prince Xaolin Valmyr and Princess Maria Zevaran, both tied together for sake of the alliance standing just across the courtyard with some other officials to greet them after their long travel.

Elaria's gaze immediately locked on Maria, the dark blue dress she wore, her goldish black hair, her calm eyes, and a friendly warm smile on her face, tying her hands in front as she saw the guests enter. Xaolin on the other hand looked a bit serious, though his face showed a slight smile, but his sharp eyes didn't back it up. They both stepped a few paces as the guest entered the courtyard.

"Your highness, allow me to introduce you to Azekial Beauford, the commander of the Azlari army, sent by the king as the envoy," the Azlari servant the envoy brought along said as he bowed.

"And this is Prince Xaolin Valmyr II, ruler of the Dawngard kingdom and his wife Maria Zevaran," the Dawngard official said as he gestured toward Maria, she bowed with a smile, "Daughter of King Theron Zevaran IV."

The envoy bowed, with a friendly but fake smile on his face.

"And this your highness," the servant gestured toward Elaria, "Is the daughter of the Prime Advisor Cassimar Aelvan, Lady Elaria," Elaria bowed her head.

"We've heard about your mother, she was from Zevaria, wasn't she?" Maria looked at her as she said, her tone soft and friendly, her mouth wide with a smile.

"Yes, your highness...," Elaria answered without gazing at her directly, as she lowered her head.

"Then that makes Zevaria your home as well," Maria said.

Elaria's lips widened as she gave her a smile as she nodded.

Maria smiled back and she looked at Senara, her eyes sharpened slightly, her face curious.

The servant noticed Maria's curiousness and he spoke, "She..., your highness, she's the companion of lady Elaria, they grew up together in Azlari before coming to Shinobi Islands."

Senara bowed, her tone respectful and formal, "Your highness..."

"Nice to meet you, Lady Senara," Maria said, in her natural warm tone.

After the formals, the Prince gestured them to come inside, he told them that their rooms are prepared and they may rest after the long voyage and that they also have a long journey ahead of them.

Later, when the night cloaked over, Elaria sat alone in her room, lit by candle light. Wearing the white night dress, standing by the window, she brushed her fingers in her short hair that just reached her neck, she looked at her reflection in the small mirror picked from the table, her eyes tired from the nights she spent without sleep on the deck.

A knock on the door, Elaria's eyes turned toward it, _Who could this be, at this time of the night? Senara? She's still awake?_ , "Yes...?" she asked politely.

The door creaked open slowly, "I hope I didn't ruin your sleep," Maria, a warm smile on her face as she leaned in from the half opened door.

Elaria saw her and stood up, her hands tied in front her, "Your highness...," as she bowed.

Maria stepped in, closing her door behind her, "It's okay, there's no need for that," Maria gestured with her hand.

She sat down on the bed, gestured Elaria to come and sit beside her, Elaria bowed and sat beside her.

"It must feel strange..., coming here, the land your mother was from," Maria said as she looked at Elaria.

Elaria swallowed as she took a moment to answer, "A foreign land still..., besides I don't even remember her face," she paused, "She died when I was three."

"I'm sorry to hear that, " Maria put her hand on Elaria's back, "But that doesn't cut off your ties with Zevaria," she said in a comforting tone, "I've heard stories about girls that were taken from the Shinobi Islands during the war of the Crimson Sea, we heard one of them was taken into marriage by Cassimar, who became the Prime Advisor to the King."

"Yes..., the same one I was told growing up..., she was taken from the Islands when Azlarians took them," Elaria answered in a low voice.

"So..., how did she die?" Maria's brows furrowed as she asked, "She was still young."

"I was told she fell sick, stayed on bed for three or four days, before she took her final breath, I...," she paused, turned her eyes toward the window, "I only remember when a maid came to me saying your mother is dead, I ran into that room, crying and screaming, apart from that..., nothing," she turned her head down.

"You might've kept something, to remind you of her..."

"Yes..," Elaria answered, she leaned toward the table on the side of her bed, she reached out for the locket and showed it to Maria, "This was my mother's."

Maria took it into her hands, she looked at it curiously but something felt familiar about it, she felt it but couldn't say it, _This looks familiar, but I don't know what, I've seen this before somewhere_.

She returned it to Elaria, they talk about the travel and the voyage. Elaria felt comfortable around her after a few moments of hesitation. Maria's warm and friendly tone let down Elaria's guard just enough so she frankly spoke with her about their stay at the island and their journey, but not reveal her true purpose of spying. Curiosity led her to discussing about the story of Arlen she heard on the island, Maria talked about her younger brother, making Elaria wonder about him even more. Maria then stood up saying it's too late into the night and she should rest now, and she leaves the room.
