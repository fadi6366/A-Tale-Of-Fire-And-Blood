# Power system (The story of the Pheonix and Blood Raven)


# Origin

The powers originate from an eternal energy that comes from the flame of the Pheonix. The Pheonix was born from the flame of [[Ogon, the Flamebringer.]]  The Pheonix is the source of the eternal energy and chooses an avatar when it deems necessary since zevaran dynasty only 3 avatars have been chosen :
1. Arkan
2. Jiserion V (The great civil war , 790's)
3. Arlen's generation

Choosing a generation means multiple heralds or those who will aid the chosen. It's completely random but this a generation has been chosen. Their fates are tied together meaning at some point in life they'll cross paths with Arlen or already they are on good terms with him.

# Working

The user draws the power from the eternal energy that is inside them, it drains as they use it, and needs time to recover, if they use it completely they're temporarily cut off the link with the pheonix as the avatar. It can be permanent if they try to force it through any means, or they try to force their bending out. It can be felt when the energy is completely drained and then returns. The eternal energy not only works to help them bend elements but it also helps the wielder to heal and survive severe wounds (obviously not the throat being sliced or head chopped off or a dagger or spear through the heart). But if the energy is not present temporarily the wielder does get weakened. And if they die apart from natural death, it affects the cycle and some few avatars that come next or the generations that come (3 or 4 cycles) they will be comparatively weak. 

The one's who bear the eternal energy are called descendants of [[Ogon, the Flamebringer.]]

The Raven's herald doesnot draw power from the eternal energy, they use their own blood to bend elements. ( their bending is relatively dark and can be clearly seen) but they also if use too much power at once they also get weakened, as they risk their blood getting drained, not only that they also get corrupted if they use the power too much, and that's what the raven wants, he wants the herald to do his job for him only to turn him into a mind controlled puppet or the raven's human form like the raven transfers his concious into the herald's body once the raven gets the sun's energy to go dark. The blood raven rarely chooses an avatar, as compared to the Pheonix, the raven only chooses when he rises, maybe once in a 2000 years or more.

# Risks

Too much times back to back this happens and the cycle risks being broken, allowing the evil twin of the pheonix , the blood raven to affect the sun with it's dark essence and dwelve the world into eternal darkness or a corrupted world under the raven's influence, ruled by a puppet the raven will plant there like his own dark herald.

If the chosen of pheonix uses the power that are dark they risk being corrupted by the raven and also the dark powers will use up twice the eternal energy they have compared to the normal powers.
# Role in History of Zevaria


1. **Arkan**
	- He did use the power to help him conquer the world, but he destroyed the scrolls and books so no one in the future generations can learn about it.
2. **Jiserion V** 
	- It is not necessary that a chosen showcases their powers in their cycle, they can do the stuff still, like Jiserion V. He didn't use the power but did affect history as he prevented the [[Zevaran Dynasty]] from ending. Jiserion knew about it but he was wise enough to not use them un necessarily, he did write a journal so that any future avatar if they are chosen and find that book, they can learn about it he also re wrote the ancient scrolls that had survived Arkan's burning of them.


# Basic Elements


| Element | Blood Raven counterpart |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| Fire    | lightning               |
| water   | blood                   |
| earth   | metal                   |
| air     | toxens                  |


The Pheonix chosen can use the dark elements as well but it'll take them double the eternal energy required.
