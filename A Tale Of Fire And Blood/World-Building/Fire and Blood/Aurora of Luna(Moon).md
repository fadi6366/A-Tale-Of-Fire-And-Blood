The moon has it's own role in the power system of this world. As the moon is responsible for the tides of the planet. It is linked solely to the spirit, purity and water. The Aurora is the equivalent of the eternal energy but different. Unlike the eternal energy the aurora doesnot need days to recharge. The wielder can simply wait for night of full moon to come and only at that night the Moon recharges the Aurora.

Like Phoenix and Raven, aurora is the energy of Aetherwing, another mythical figure in the world. But unlike it's two counter parts, Aetherwing is the embodiment of peace and calm energy. No conflict with the other two.

The Aetherwing existed even before Ogon was born, since the moons were there. Aetherwing was the reason Ogon didn't fire up both moons and only one. Aetherwing was the one who told Ogon to fire up the moon in the first place.

It can't be unlocked or taken, you have it by birth. It's also based on the principle of Phoenix and Raven chosen. But there is no lineage, it can be completely random. The aurora gives the wielder following abilities:

1. Bend the fluids(all types, everything included).
2. Healing abilities.
3. Ability to sense the chosen and heralds.
4. Enchant weapons (with aurora magic), making them more stronger.
	1. Arrows enchantment means they'll freeze the target they're shot on. Retaining their original property of cutting through.
	2. Swords, spears and other metal based weapons also can be enchanted.

Unlike the other two Aetherwing has connections with the creatures, mainly elves not humans. The wielder can talk to Aetherwing in live time but it will seem they're self talking.
