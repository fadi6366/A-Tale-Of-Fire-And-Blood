The world was without a sun since the dawn of time. Everywhere was a dark long night. Life almost didn't exist. Then a dragon was born, Ogon. He roamed the world, alone, gazing in the faint light of the two moons. He grew at a staggering rate year by year. Every year he spent in the world he grew. At 500 years of age he flew up and threw his flame at one of the moons, for almost a week. Finally the core melted and the surface cracked, and then, a blast, resulting in the sun. Life started to appear.

But millenia later the light and warmth had started to fade, Ogon saw the world get colder and colder by the decade. At 6500 years he once again flew up, but this time bigger and stronger than before. He threw his flame at it again and this time the effect was near permanent. Enough for it to be going for hundreds and thousands of Millenia to come. Life had now started to thrive.

roamed the world. Ogon then lived on for a total of 10000 years, birth to death. Near his death he had grown to such a colossal size that modern day Zevaragrad will fall under his shadow if he ever had set foot near it.

Ogon went to rest in the same place he was born, Dragon Valley, the birth place of the dragons as well. He died after 10 years of rest there. His body then slowly rotted away as the time passed, remains buried under the ground or eroded.
