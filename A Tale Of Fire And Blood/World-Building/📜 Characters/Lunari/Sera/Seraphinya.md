- **The Hooded Mantle:** She wears a **thick, plum-colored mantle** draped over her shoulders. It includes a large hood that rests behind her head and transitions into long, flowing fabric that mimics the movement of her hair.
    
- **Layered Sleeves:** Beneath the mantle, the sleeves are a mix of teal and purple fabrics, showing a more fluid, cloth-based silhouette now that the silver bracers have been removed.
    

### Details and Accessories

- **Gold Filigree:** The edges of the teal fabric are lined with **gold embroidery**, especially visible along the waist and the plunging neckline.
    
- **Gemstones:** Small, **teardrop-shaped blue jewels** are set into the gold trim at the hips, catching the light and adding a touch of elegance.
    
- **Hair Ornamentation:** Her silver-lavender hair is held by a **circular silver hairclip** with a large blue gem at its center, further accented by two long, beaded hairpins.
