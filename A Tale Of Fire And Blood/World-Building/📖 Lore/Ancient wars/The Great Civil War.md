Occuring in the decade of 790's AC. This war shook the empire from within. Dividing it into 5 parts that were under the five sons of King Feodor II.  Jiserion V , one of his sons rose the strongest among the brothers. Defeating them all and then re uniting the empire once again.

The brothers who fought the war:

1. Jiserion V.
2. Lauferios.
3. Aleksion.
4. Lazar.
5. Vlodian.

The war lasted for 8 years though it wasn't battles and fight all the time. After King Feodor's death in the early months of 790 AC, it started in the form of a cold war between the brothers. Vlodian being the eldest was named the heir by Feodor, but wasn't accepted by the other four as each of them wanted the throne for themselves.

It triggered a silent cold war among the brothers. That went on for almost a year. 

Major ones listed here:

1. In 791 AC Lazar and his allies rebelled against Vlodian. Aleksion initially who apparently was on Vlodian's side left him at the last moment when Vlodian gathered his forces for the battle against Lazar. Aleksion refused to send the aid he promised to Vlodian. Though Vlodian won that fight but almost had lost because of the forces not arriving at the time for whom he waited. This was one of many battle to be fought.
2. Later that year when Aleksion was marching toward the capital to take the throne from Vlodian his forces were intercepted by Lauferios who now had stepped into the great game. Aleksion was defeated in that battle and lost almost all half his forces. Lauferios who now had won against Aleksion, now was also in this brutal back and forth for the throne was almost killed in an assasination attempt while sleeping in his tent in the battle camp.
3. Jiserion remained silent until the ending months of 791 AC. When 792 AC stepped in Jiserion laid siege on one of the southern cities and declared that part of Zevaria under his control and independent. Now the empire was divided into 5 smaller states:

	1. The centre- capital and the surrounding places and provinces under **Vlodian.** 
	2. The southern parts under **Jiserion.**
	3. The areas west of the black peaks under **Lazar.**
	4. The south west under **Lauferios.**
	5. The northern steppes under **Aleksion.** 

4. In 793 AC Vlodian was killed in a battle against Lazar, leaving the centre of the empire without a king. Now the civil war became even more brutal with the capital being sieged once every few months as each of the brothers tried to take it from the other. 
5. In 795 AC Lazar sat on the throne who would now rule the throne of Zevaragrad until the end of the civil war. At this point Zevaria as an empire was like a ghost of the past as it had been now divided into smaller ones for almost 5 years now. Each fighting the other over the crown.
6. In 797 AC when Jiserion came to know he was the next chosen of the Phoenix he now knew it would be easy for him to take the throne from Lazar.
7. In Ironhollow 797 AC Lauferios was assasinated during his sleep. Many say it was his wife who did it on the order of Lazar. Many say she was a spy all along, working for Aleksion.
8. Jiserion and Aleksion faced off in Fyrmont 798 AC. This battle was won by Jiserion as many of Aleksion's loyalists had sided with Jiserion now. Jiserion also now had taken the areas that were previously under Lauferios and Lazar(since he was now in the capital, ruling as king. Jiserion had now taken over the West.) Aleksion was killed in this battle, Jiserion himself decapitated him.
9. The final battle was the siege of Zevaragrad by Jiserion that lasted for a month. In the ending days of Snowtide the imperial forces surrendered and Jiserion entered the capital. Taking Lazar captive and prisoner. Lazar died in his improsenment. Many say he killed himself, some say Jiserion secretly ordered to kill him and then later had the killer executed. But no one knows how exactly Lazar died. Leaving Zevaragrad under Jiserion's control now.


The Bloomrise of 798 AC was celebrated came and the spring festival was celebrated along side with the victory and the proper coronation of Jiserion as the King of Zevaria. The civil war that lasted for about 8 years had finally came to an end.

Jiserion now worked hard to bring back the empire together as many smaller states have been formed as the lords had declared independence. Many areas were taken in control by Jiserion when he marched to capital but most were left. Jiserion fought against those who refused to give in. These wars went on for almost four more years and in 802 AC finally once again Zevaria was one again as an empire.


The empire flourished under Jiserion especially after what it had gone through in last 12 years. Jiserion worked hard to bring it back to it's feet. Which he did successfully earning him the title
Jiserion V the wise king.
