The Merds came into power in 1500 BC and after 90 years they started wars against the Sevarians.

The last war was fought between not the Merds and Sevarians but the chosen of the phoenix and the herald of the phoenix. The known version is that a prince escaped the massacre whose descendants later found the Ashveil and Zevarans.

The Merd ruler of the time was Riuka who was the Raven's herald and the Sevarian King was the phoenix chosen Livaan.

Livaan wasn't able to stop the massacre of his people i.e the Sevarian family and their sucessors with mostly of them being wiped out by Riuka. Livaan defeated Riuka but decided not to take the throne, marking the end of the Sevarian empire in 1387 BC. He set out on his own journey which no one knows what, as the fact is that Livaan had a son named Atar who was 4 at that time. Atar was the one who's off spring became the ashveil and later the Zevarans.

The Merds continued to reign under the rule of Lurian, the nephew of Riuka. Later on the dynasty died it's own death in 1005 BC.
