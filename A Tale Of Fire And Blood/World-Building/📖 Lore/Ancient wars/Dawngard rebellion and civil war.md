Three centuries before the present day, Dawngard rebelled against the Zevaran throne, led by Richard Valmyr of the powerful Valmyr clan.
The civil war raged fiercely; Dawngard’s armies pushed dangerously close to the capital, Zevaragrad.

Valdrek I, then a commander in the royal army, was tasked with a desperate mission:

> to ambush a Valmyr column marching toward the capital.

With a small host, Valdrek I carried out a daring night assault, slaying over 2,000 Valmyr soldiers.
Though the war ultimately ended in Dawngard’s favor — winning them greater independence in return for a promise that each generation a Zevaran princess would marry a Dawngard prince — Valdrek I’s bravery saved the capital from likely siege.

In gratitude, the Zevaran king granted Valdrek I lands on the southern frontier, near the border of Dawngard, and the right to found a new noble tribe: the Valdrek.
From that day, the Valdrek clan swore loyalty directly to the throne, serving as wardens of the marches and watchers of Dawngard.

 Valdrek I’s ambush saved the capital itself from being besieged → this prevented total collapse of the Zevaran regime or the capital falling, which would have ended the dynasty.
BUT:
Dawngard still won many battles elsewhere
Dawngard’s armies controlled huge stretches of their homeland and threatened key trade routes
Zevaria’s royal army was stretched thin, exhausted, and the war was unpopular.
The Zevaran king couldn’t reconquer Dawngard fully without risking rebellion at home
In the end, the Zevaran king had to negotiate peace:
Dawngard accepted nominal fealty to the Zevaran Empire
In return, they kept practical independence, and the royal marriage pact was established to keep peace
 Valdrek I’s ambush changed the scale of defeat:
❌ Dawngard didn’t take the capital, didn’t topple the dynasty
✅ But Dawngard still got what they wanted: more autonomy and dignity
