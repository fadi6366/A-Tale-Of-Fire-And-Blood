Author name: Cathal Melor(1407 AC-1489 AC)
Written in: 1435 AC.

Author history: Cathal Malor was a young scholar who had huge interest in history of the world. He belonged to a small town in the eastern lands of Zevaria. Just few miles away approx. 10 to 15 from the city of scrolls, Thalenor. It was and still is the centre of knowledge of the empire. Many aspiring masters, scholars come and spend years here studying science and different knowledges of the world, arts as well.

Cathal was impressed by the long history of Zevaria and he was astonished by the stories of huge figures like Arkan the conqueror and Jiserion V the wise king. Cathal also had studied about the Pre Zevaran era and came to learn about the empires that stood before Zevaria, i.e Kanari, The Merds and the Sevarians. Cathal came to the city of Thalenor at the age of just 10 because since his childhood he had this huge interest to study about the world. 

At Thalenor he learnt many things about the known history of the world. He also learnt about the pre-Zevaran era.

During this Cathal came across the knowledge that was never meant to be revealed to the common folk by the masters of Thalenor.

He decided to write a book where he will put all his life's learnings and knowledge into one place. 

Cathal was 43 when he started to write "The Chronicle" the book which contained all the knowledge about the world he had learnt in those 33 years. As he learnt more and more, the book expanded further. At 48 he finally finished the book. He kept on adding to it as his life progressed.

Thalenor city of scrolls : Most of the world's apparently lost knowledge could be found here in Thalenor:

1. Like the stories of Kanari empire that people don't know in general, the reason for it to be refered as a ghost of the past.
2. The brutal wars between the Merds and the Sevarians.
3. The tales of Arkan and Rosavelle. (Pretty common story but mostly forgotten among the people due to passed centuries.)
4. The folk tales of Jeron the dread.
5. Many more....

Basically it's the centre of literature and history in Zevaria. Many more things can be found in the hidden chambers under the libraries here. Most of the knowledge hidden away from the common folk.

2. Cathal's own philosophy
3. His knowledge he got during studies

Impact and the book:

The book was read by masters and they came to know Cathel had gotten access to the knowledge they didn't want the world to know. They told Cathel to abandon or destroy the book but he didn't. After his death in 1489 AC the masters decided if this book one day get's out the knowledge they want to remain hidden wont be anymore hidden. So they decided to take that part out.

The people of Zevaria know the Chronicle as only the part which contains Cathel's personal philosophy, his knowledge he gained throughout his life, his travel logs and his quotes. But almost no one knows the original Chronicle and what it truly contained. Even the current generation of masters dont know about this or the hidden place where those parts of the Chronicle as buried or hidden. They think the other volumes are the entire book. 

The masters had done this so precisely, cutting any mentions of the forbidden knowledge in the other volumes so no one could ever find out.


Cathal himself is a popular figure among the masters, they respect him and his work. Apart from the Chronicle he has written multiple books and scrolls that contain his knowledge and philosophy.
The chronicle was the summary of the entire collection of Cathal's work in one narrative.

He died in 1489 AC.
