In the name of the Everlasting Throne of Zevaria and the ancient blood of Dawngard, let this accord be set in ink and memory.



I. On Fealty and Sovereignty
The Kingdom of Dawngard shall remain a realm within the dominion of the Zevaran Empire, owing fealty to the Dragon Throne.
Dawngard shall govern its lands, laws, and councils without interference, save that its sovereign shall pledge loyalty to the Zevaran Emperor.

---

II. On Marriage and Blood
In each generation, one daughter of the ruling house of Zevaran shall be wedded to a prince or direct heir of Dawngard.
This union shall bind the two realms in kinship and peace; the children born of such union shall carry titles in both courts.

---

III. On Tribute and Trade
Dawngard shall pay annual tribute of silver and grain, symbol of its allegiance.
Free trade shall continue across the shared border; merchants and caravans bearing the seal of either realm shall pass unmolested.

---

IV. On Arms and Hostilities
Dawngard shall not raise armies against the Zevaran Empire nor harbor traitors to the Dragon Throne.
In turn, the Emperor shall not march the Royal Host into Dawngard save in common defense.
