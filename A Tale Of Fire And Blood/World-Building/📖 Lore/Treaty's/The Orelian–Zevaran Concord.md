✦ The Orelian–Zevaran Concord (1701 AC)

Context:
Signed in the first weeks of 1701 AC, just after the dawn of a new century.
Framed publicly as a gesture of “renewed goodwill” between Orelia and Zevaria, following decades of border tension and skirmishes since the War of the Crimson Sea (ended 1676 AC).

Key terms proposed by the Orelian envoy:

1. Trade Guarantees

Mutual lowering of tariffs on certain luxury goods (spices, silks, lacquerware from the Eastern Isles; fine Zevaran silver and glass).

Orelian merchants offered limited docking rights closer to Zevaragrad itself rather than only Dawngard’s coastal ports — positioned as “easing trade bottlenecks.”



2. Cultural & Diplomatic Exchange

Annual envoy from Orelia to winter court in Zevaragrad, and vice versa.

Formal recognition of Zevaria’s right to keep its current western border, while Orelia formally recognizes the Eastern Isles as theirs — intended as a symbolic act to ‘close old wounds.’



3. Disputed Lands Registry (Rejected by Theron)

Orelia proposed a “joint commission” to formally map and mark the still-disputed isles and coastal shoals taken in the War of the Crimson Sea — framed as “clarifying sovereignty,” but Theron saw it as a subtle way to question Zevaria’s claim.



4. Extended Presence (hidden agenda)

Orelia quietly expects that by opening new trade posts deeper inland, they’ll be able to establish safehouses, gather intelligence, and subtly funnel influence — a foothold for future leverage.




Real motive (unknown to Zevaria):
Orelia’s ruling council sees this Concord not as a peace treaty, but as a strategic move:

To plant agents under diplomatic cover.

To weaken Zevaria’s vigilance by speaking of peace.

And, if needed, to create a casus belli later by provoking an incident near the newly opened trade posts.
