Arlen asks for reinforcements from the nearest city. Arlen will call in 2000 men from Grimwood. 

While at the nest before leaving he will tell one of his men a spot to visit daily at dusk, until they don't come and give a signal. Arlen will tell him to blow up the greyfire cans in their weapons inventory. Then in the chaos of the smoke riders trying to extinguish the fire, the other soldier will open the main gate. Arlen and his men will charge in from the main gate.
