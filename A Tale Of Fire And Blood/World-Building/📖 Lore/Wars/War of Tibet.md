Major highlight: 

2 battles which arlen went head on with the enemy

1. Battle at Dharan
	in one of them he was told they are brining elephants
	Arlen  made a master move, they layed down grey-fire (gun powder) in the battle field in a linear way.
	
	the next day when the enemy host arrived and they faced head on and charged with elephants
	
	arlen's order and arcxhers shot flaming arrows where the gunpower was layed the elephants were overwhelmed and they ran trampling their own army men beneath their feet.
	
	arlen knew how his plan would unfold so much of his army was positioned away like they appeared when the blasts happened and about a 5th of the enemy host was crushed under their own elephant feets
	arlen used hit and run to lure the enemy from toward the fire line, he had his archers mounted on horses at the vanguard. the rest of the army was positioned a little far behind. He signalled the archers on the horses and they rode towards the enemy, loosen arrows and then rode back. this made the enemy to send its cavalry forward and then the elephants before the infantry.


	the cavalry that crossed the fire line was taken down by arlen's 50000 cavalry positioned on two sides of the area the enemy horsmen rode into. when the elephants reached the fireline. the archers loosened flaming arrows, the elephants were overwhelmed and they ran back trumpling a crucial part of the enemy infantry
	
	  
	the enemy lost their 70000 strong part of the cavalry as it ran staright into an ambush. one fifth of the infantry was trumpled by the 2000 elephants they brought.
	
	  
	after loosing 25000 cavalry, and 20000 infantrymen
	
	  
	the enemy was left with with 80000 men left that were then charged by 30000 strong dawngard cavalry arlen brought. followed by 50000 infantry men waiting behind.
	
	  
	the rest 70000 was in reserve if any thing went wrong. but it didnt . the cavalry charge was so strong it struck them badly before the infantry reached them. and in a matter of hours. 250000 strong host was desrtoyed with over 50000 casualties and 20000 men being wounded, the rest fleed the battle field
