Here is the map of the known world 1700AC:

![[MapChart_Map (1).png]]

 
### 🟥 **Zevaria Empire (core):**

- Heartland: Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Eastern Europe
    
- Capital: **Zevaragrad**
    
- Military:
    
    - Royal Guard (500k, elite)
        
    - Field armies (3 million)
        
    - Clans loyal to throne (5 million)
        
    - **Free Arm** (500k mercenaries hired to hold wild frontiers)

## 🏴‍☠️ **The Black Flags**

- Elite, ancient border armies of Zevaria — symbol: black banners against silver spears
    
- Stationed in the south, guarding trade routes & the border near the Sasanian realm (Iran on your real-world map)
    
- **Tradition:**
    
    - Sworn to absolute loyalty to the **throne itself**, not to a _specific_ king or prince
        
    - Vow never to interfere in _succession disputes or palace intrigues_
        
    - “The Black serve the Throne, not the Man who sits upon it.”
        
- **Crucial point:**
    
    - Their neutrality means whichever side controls the capital holds the southern gates
        
    - If they _ever_ took sides, the balance of power would tilt massively
        
    - Sasanian rulers know this → they stay close to the Black Flags diplomatically (trade, gifts, border treaties) hoping to secure favorable trade even if Zevaria fractures

## 🏺 **Sasanians (Iran)**

- Powerful kingdom to the south
    
- Trade partners with Zevaria; export textiles, spices, glass; import northern furs, iron, grain
    
- Respect the Black Flags deeply; have a history of sending “gifts of friendship” to the Black banners
    
- If civil war breaks:
    
    - Sasanians could either:  
        ✅ Remain neutral & keep trade open  
        ✅ Secretly back Arlen (if they think he’ll protect trade better)  
        ✅ Or play both sides to weaken Zevaria & gain territory

### 🟪 **Indus Tribes:**

- Semi-autonomous, buffer zone
    
- Crucial to block the Southern Tribes & 2nd World influence
    
- Currently loyal to Zevaria
    

---

### 🟩 **Southern Tribes:**

- Allied with the **2nd World**
    
- Rebellious, want to break Zevarian control
    
- Threat from the south
    

---

### 🟨 **Dawngard:**

- Vassal state (China, Mongolia, Koreas)
    
- Nominally bows to Zevaria, but could rebel or side with 2nd World
    

---
## 🌊 **East Isles**

- Chain of islands east of Dawngard (roughly the Japan/Korean archipelago on your real-world map)
    
- Formerly tribute-paying states to Zevaria during Arken Zevaran’s conquest
    
- After his death, they rebelled and over decades were lost
    
- Now **firmly controlled by the 2nd World** (the great foreign superpower across the sea)
    
- Used by the 2nd World as:  
    ✅ Naval bases  
    ✅ Spy networks  
    ✅ Staging ground for possible invasion into Dawngard or Zevaria’s eastern coast
    
- Zevaria still claims them symbolically in royal titles, but in reality, they’re gone
    
- **Strategic importance:**  
    If the 2nd World sees Zevaria weaken (civil war, rebellion), fleets could launch from East Isles to invade Dawngard or strike Zevaria’s vulnerable eastern ports

*** 

### 🟩 **2nd World (green):**

- Foreign superpower (America + allies)
    
- Waiting to invade if Zevaria crumbles
    
- Supports southern tribes secretly
    

---

###  **Turks :**

- Autonomous, independent steppe confederation
    
- Once fierce raiders of Zevaria’s western frontier centuries ago
    
- After Arken Zevaran’s conquest, peace treaties and trade routes were established
    
- **Now they trade**: horses, furs, steppe iron, salt — in exchange for Zevarian grain, silk, weapons
    
- Still culturally proud and militaristic, but raids have stopped; the memory of old wars lingers in stories & songs
    
- Their neutrality is _valuable_ — Zevaria fears pushing them too hard might turn them back into enemies
    

---

###  **Western Tribes :**

- Fragmented clans & horse tribes beyond Zevaria’s western frontier
    
- No single ruler — small warbands unite & split constantly
    
- Famous for **fast cavalry raids, ambushes, and scorched-earth tactics**
    
- Too scattered to face Zevaria’s field armies head-on, but deadly if the empire is distracted
    
- During peace, raids are smaller & often paid off by local Zevarian lords with gold or trade
    
- **But:** if civil war breaks out inside Zevaria, they could swarm over the western provinces before any force can stop them
    
- Known in Zevarian chronicles as _“The Smoke Riders”_ because they appear, burn villages, and vanish like smoke


The west
![[MapChart_Map_thwest.png]] 

Vargoth – or the “western tribes,” but really a brutal northern kingdom with old wolf banners, frost-bound fjords, raiders and jarls.

They’re officially enemies of Zevaria (and likely Orelia too), yet black-market trade and backdoor deals still happen.

They’re the ones stirring trouble now: sending assassins or elite raiders across the border, testing the kingdom’s defenses.


Kezhar – the Turkic-inspired power to the south or southeast.

Mostly neutral but fiercely protective of their trade routes.

They might watch the Zevaria–Orelia rivalry carefully, playing both sides if it profits them.


Caelara – your Rome analogue.

Former imperial glory, old stone cities, marble forums, legacies of conquest.

They trade with both Zevaria and Orelia, selling fine cloth, wine, and bronze or silverwork.


Bryndale – your Britain analogue.

Green islands and stormy seas, known for wool, iron, and a stubborn independence.

Merchant fleets cross eastward, trading with Zevaria’s coastal cities and even the Eastern Isles when the seas are calm.





Zevaria & Orelia: long-standing rivals with patches of trade, uneasy peace.

Vargoth: old enemies of both, openly hostile but still part of the gray market.

Caelara & Bryndale: profitable neutral traders; old allies at times, but driven by commerce more than loyalty.

Kezhar: shrewd observers, selling to whoever pays, but careful not to get pulled into a northern war.
